Sure, there's a few out there, but not many that are decent. I have used <a href=\"http://www.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/FLV-Player-Screenshot-27852.html\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">FLV Player 1.3.3</a>, but it's not up to much when you're trying to preview or edit files. Adobe's own <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/productinfo/encoder/\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">Flash Video Encoder</a> is worse than id've thought it would be. You can only encode once, and you can't decode, edit or view the files afterwards. We have been promised the arrival of the <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Media_Player\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">Adobe Media Player</a>, but that's no comfort until it actually materializes.</p>\n<p>By far the best solution for playing Flash Video so far is the <a href=\"http://www.richapps.de/?p=48\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">RichFLV 2</a> - an Apollo-based desktop FLV Player. It's in Alpha stage of production, (isn't everything nowadays?) but it's already looking far more promising than any competition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2007/05/adobe-apollo.png\" alt=\"Adobe Apollo CS3\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Flash Video - the Solution?","date":"May 28, 2007","tags":["flash","air","tools"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/kuler-desktop-released/","tags":["air","colour","downloadable-applications","kuler","resources","tools"],"title":"Kuler Desktop released!","date":"2007-05-28T13:25:54.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/rss-bling-or-no-bling/","tags":["design","rss-tag"],"title":"RSS.
