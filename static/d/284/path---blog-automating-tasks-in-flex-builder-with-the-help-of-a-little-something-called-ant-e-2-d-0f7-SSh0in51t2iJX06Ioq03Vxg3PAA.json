replace, but can also execute command-line instructions or be extended to support additional tasks (like FTP transfers).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Links;</h3>\n<p>Here’s a couple of useful links on how you can use ANT in conjunction with Flex Builder;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/dctrl/deploy-flex-with-apache-ant-presentation\">http://www.slideshare.net/dctrl/deploy-flex-with-apache-ant-presentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://dispatchevent.org/mims/ant-for-flex-part-1/\">http://dispatchevent.org/mims/ant-for-flex-part-1/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've misplaced my bookmarks for the rest, but I'll find them and post them when I can.  In the meantime, Google will serve as the path to enlightenment for those ready to walk the path...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Automating tasks in Flex Builder, with the help of a little something called 'ANT'.","date":"December 04, 2009","tags":["flex","ant","eclipse","flex-builder","ftp"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/targeting-multiple-browsers-with-css-and-some-javascript-trickery/","tags":["css","javascript"],"title":"Targeting multiple browsers with CSS... and some Javascript trickery.","date":"2009-11-28T08:00:19.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/the-flash-platform-in-your-tv/","tags":["flash-platform","open-screen-project","youtube"],"title":"The Flash Platform in your TV?","date":"2009-12-10T08:36:18.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}
