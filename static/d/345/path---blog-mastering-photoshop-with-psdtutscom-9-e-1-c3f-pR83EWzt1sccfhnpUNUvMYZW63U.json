Off like a dynamo with the Photoshop tutorials, I'd certainly keep an eye on it - looks to have potential to be another Smashing Magazine. (i.e. A big hit)</p>\n<p>Now, my knowledge of Photoshop is ok, certainly on-par with those I work with, but Psdtuts? I'm a complete novice against them. I tried to do a couple of their tutorials as a demonstration, but they didn't turn out so good. They make it look so easy, but I guess you need some mystical, innate knowledge if you're going to compete.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://psdtuts.com/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\"><img src=\"/content/images/2007/10/11.jpg\" alt=\"A sample improvement from photoshop\"></a></p>\n<p>My favourates have got to be;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://psdtuts.com/photo-effects-tutorials/souping-up-a-photo/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">Souping up a photo.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://psdtuts.com/photo-effects-tutorials/super-slick-dusky-lighting-effects-in-photoshop/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">Super-slick lighting effects</a></li>\n<li>[Creating an] <a href=\"http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/creating-a-stunning-old-world-look-in-photoshop/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">Olde Worlde look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>What else can I say? <a href=\"http://psdtuts.com/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">go have a gawk</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mastering Photoshop with psdtuts.com","date":"October 08, 2007","tags":["design","external-links","resources"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/debugging-flash-movies-with-fiddler-2/","tags":["external-links","debugging-tools","ie-plugins"],"title":"Debugging Flash Movies with Fiddler 2","date":"2007-10-07T09:14:19.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/xhtml-hyperlinks-and-separating-content-from-style/","tags":["html","javascript","hyperlinks","xhtml"],"title":"XHTML, Hyperlinks and separating content from style.","date":"2007-10-15T20:58:51.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}
