 Who cares that 44 thousand people have tweeted about the snow falling?  Not me.  What IS good though, is the fact that it's so quick and irreverant.  Full-on blogging takes ages to string together sentances to post.  Ok, you get more meaning across, but it takes longer.  Tweeting something takes a few seconds, and with a liberal smattering of keywords, lots of people read it.</p>\n<p>The TweetDeck search implimentation is a killer feature.  Setup a search on keywords, and moments after it's posted, it'll appear on your desktop.  Want to know if anyone's talked about something, put in a search and you'll find out.  I've been tweeted twice this week, and I never even knew.</p>\n<p>Oh and building on the searches, it's a good way to seek out people interested in the same things as you, network, make friends, etcetera.</p>\n<h3>Follow me!</h3>\n<p>Hey, if you want to see what I tweet about, check out: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/psyked_james\">http://twitter.com/psyked_james</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm on Twitter.","date":"February 05, 2009","tags":["twitter"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/data-binding-an-array-in-flex/","tags":["flex","array","arraycollection"],"title":"Data Binding an Array in Flex?","date":"2009-02-02T09:45:35.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/google-analytics-within-flexflash-applications/","tags":["flash","flex","air","google-analytics"],"title":"Google Analytics within Flex/Flash Applications","date":"2009-02-05T13:30:06.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}
