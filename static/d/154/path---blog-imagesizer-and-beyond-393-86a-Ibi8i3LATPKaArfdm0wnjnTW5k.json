ImageSizer 2 development is underway now, and there should be some more updates on the way.</p>\n<h3>And also...</h3>\n<p>As my code-signing certificates all went out of date, it makes it a little difficult for the automatic updates to keep everyone up to date.  The application source code is incompatible with the latest version of the Flex SDK, I want to re-architect the application source, and I think that the interface needs a complete re-think to integrate some of the newer application features.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&#x26;offeringid=10740&#x26;marketplaceid=1\">download ImagesSizer through the AIR Marketplace.</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ImageSizer -- and beyond(!)","date":"July 28, 2010","tags":["imagesizer","air-applications"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/a-more-advanced-starrequests-simple-box2d-flickr-example/","tags":["box2d"],"title":"A more advanced StarRequests, Simple-Box2D & Flickr example.","date":"2010-07-01T08:00:28.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/xjsfl-that-looks-pretty-cool/","tags":["flash","jquery","jsfl"],"title":"xJSFL - That looks pretty cool.","date":"2010-08-27T08:42:51.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAIAAADwazoUAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAB0UlEQVQoz21Su27UQBSdP6BHoqXgAyIqREfJN9DQUtEhaBESTQQUhA8gUqL0RBACSwNS2M2u7U28a++uvevHeB5+zYxfLHftBAHK8dGZc6/mzsj3DjoZjU/H5nhiz1e+w2i49ALLZnEsRK6UKsuqruumqWHJMpmm+SUFoTHq6+eTmaOb5tejox8vX/cePDp7+Djwlp6/inAQRZi1iGPOGMeYEMKAnudHmKLvJ4O3O+8+HX9+/vTZi627T7bu7N+6vTruDc0zbXhqGLphGIPBAIymjXRdHw5HQF03KOWor+nvd3c/Hn44/Pblzb37O9dubF+/eb53kNflYma7rjOfLyzLcpzFdDqxbct1l9OpDZVFUaHJ3CGMUYJzJbT9g972K7P/k3KilKgqVVVl9Rfg/6ELUCZlIYRCrh+EGDPO4IhYSbleq6rI8wwAmufQm7T1bSrbaNoCPAp5YoTJjKQmSX3CY0ITzruCDmAhTJIkvcSfPBJSghMwmTz7D+nFpot7OnZeqQKIlJJRBAMgIaAdBaydRjAoHAZB2GVwiDduE+OiKOqmRmVZQBYIWxmFzlE4i1JKQAnFOILxwmuR8IEKCTcCGng3dY1+XYnmn2h9FaD+N47eU0S9yxKbAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/ba316b65744d2f0233f76bff4d452f46/3fa08/xjsfl-header.png","srcSet":"/static/ba316b65744d2f0233f76bff4d452f46/d9446/xjsfl-header.png 158w,\n/static/ba316b65744d2f0233f76bff4d452f46/2f6e7/xjsfl-header.png 315w,\n/static/ba316b65744d2f0233f76bff4d452f46/3fa08/xjsfl-header.png 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}}}
