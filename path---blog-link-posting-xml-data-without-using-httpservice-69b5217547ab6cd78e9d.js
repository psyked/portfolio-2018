The REST webservice I'm using requires raw XML data, but the HTTPService class doesn't do that.</p>\n<p>The solution?  Well, there's only one - don't use the HTTPService class, and code everything yourself.  Thankfully, this link I found tells you exactly how to do that, along with examples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tacfug.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/26/Flex--Posting-XML-without-using-mxhttpservice-\">http://tacfug.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/26/Flex--Posting-XML-without-using-mxhttpservice-</a></p>",frontmatter:{title:"Link: POSTing XML data, without using HTTPService",date:"June 21, 2009",tags:["external-links","flex","httpservice","post-tag","rest"],url:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
