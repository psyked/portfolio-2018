The REST webservice I'm using requires raw XML data, but the HTTPService class doesn't do that.</p>\n<p>The solution?  Well, there's only one - don't use the HTTPService class, and code everything yourself.  Thankfully, this link I found tells you exactly how to do that, along with examples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tacfug.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/26/Flex--Posting-XML-without-using-mxhttpservice-\">http://tacfug.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/26/Flex--Posting-XML-without-using-mxhttpservice-</a></p>",frontmatter:{title:"Link: POSTing XML data, without using HTTPService",date:"June 21, 2009",tags:["external-links","flex","httpservice","post-tag","rest"],url:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/link-rendering-native-system-icons-in-air/",tags:["air","icons"],title:"Link: Rendering native system icons in AIR",image:null,date:"2009-05-22T08:05:43.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/kick-ass-papervision-reflections/",tags:["flash","papervision-3d"],title:"Kick-ass Papervision Reflections",image:null,date:"2008-11-15T08:30:40.000Z"}}}}}});
