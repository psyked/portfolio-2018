replace, but can also execute command-line instructions or be extended to support additional tasks (like FTP transfers).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Links;</h3>\n<p>Here’s a couple of useful links on how you can use ANT in conjunction with Flex Builder;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dctrl/deploy-flex-with-apache-ant-presentation">http://www.slideshare.net/dctrl/deploy-flex-with-apache-ant-presentation</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://dispatchevent.org/mims/ant-for-flex-part-1/">http://dispatchevent.org/mims/ant-for-flex-part-1/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I\'ve misplaced my bookmarks for the rest, but I\'ll find them and post them when I can.  In the meantime, Google will serve as the path to enlightenment for those ready to walk the path...</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Automating tasks in Flex Builder, with the help of a little something called 'ANT'.",date:"December 04, 2009",tags:["flex","ant","eclipse","flex-builder","ftp"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/targeting-multiple-browsers-with-css-and-some-javascript-trickery/",tags:["css","javascript"],title:"Targeting multiple browsers with CSS... and some Javascript trickery.",date:"2009-11-28T08:00:19.000Z",description:null,image:null}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/the-flash-platform-in-your-tv/",tags:["flash-platform","open-screen-project","youtube"],title:"The Flash Platform in your TV?",date:"2009-12-10T08:36:18.000Z",description:null,image:null}}}}}});
