I’ll get onto what that means in another post, but for now I want to talk a little about using fluid widths.</p>\n<h3>Fluid widths — Pros &#x26; Cons</h3>\n<h4>Pros</h4>\n<p>There more variations to device size than can be reasonably handled with media queries and fixed or pixel-based widths, so fluid widths are a more practical and thus more useful for website layout and making the best use of the screen viewport.</p>\n<p>Using fluid widths you can reasonably expect your layout to remain as intended, and expand or shrink elements predictably, even if you haven’t designed the website for a specific resolution.</p>\n<h4>Cons</h4>\n<p>When fluid and fixed width elements meet there are issues. A commonplace and difficult issue to resolve is consistently achieving readable and balanced text within a fluid width design. Fixed font sizes equate to a fixed height, with individual variable character widths.</p>\n<p><a href="https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability" title="https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability"><strong>Readability: the Optimal Line Length</strong><br>\n<em>Having the right amount of characters on each line is key to the readability of your text.

Wouldn’t it be nicer if the font sizes scaled with the page instead?</p>\n<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Key4MifVtUocntQlHnMM9g.jpeg"></p>\n<p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/xjZl9zm6Sds?utm_source=unsplash&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_content=creditCopyText">chuttersnap</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/search/photos/whitespace?utm_source=unsplash&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Fluid widths in responsive websites.",date:"July 11, 2018",tags:["Web Development","Responsive Web Design","CSS","Front End Development"],url:"https://medium.com/@psyked/fluid-widths-in-responsive-websites-2a02499295d9",image:{childImageSharp:{sizes:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",aspectRatio:.667779632721202,src:"/static/1*Key4MifVtUocntQlHnMM9g-c1e846483b5c0fce69f4f7c26515ef7a-f2ac0.jpeg",srcSet:"/static/1*Key4MifVtUocntQlHnMM9g-c1e846483b5c0fce69f4f7c26515ef7a-567e3.jpeg 158w,\n/static/1*Key4MifVtUocntQlHnMM9g-c1e846483b5c0fce69f4f7c26515ef7a-c3206.jpeg 315w,\n/static/1*Key4MifVtUocntQlHnMM9g-c1e846483b5c0fce69f4f7c26515ef7a-f2ac0.jpeg 630w,\n/static/1*Key4MifVtUocntQlHnMM9g-c1e846483b5c0fce69f4f7c26515ef7a-0c4a5.jpeg 945w,\n/static/1*Key4MifVtUocntQlHnMM9g-c1e846483b5c0fce69f4f7c26515ef7a-4e530.jpeg 1200w",sizes:"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}},description:"Front End Design Principle Rambles #1"}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/the-importance-of-psychological-safety-in-a-team/",tags:["agileontap"],title:"[The importance of] Psychological Safety in a team",date:"2018-06-08T12:42:00.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"poképroject-from-static-html-to-react-to-nuxt-b6fbe42bab18",tags:null,title:"",date:null}}}}}});
