Â It\'s simple, but sometimes that\'s a good thing in an application, means it has focus - if you\'re going to do something, do it properly - that\'s one of the benefits of AIR, it makes it simple to create applications just like this.</p>\n<p>What the application actually does is just generate images in a few specific formats, output the files (in a format useful for your own AIR applications) and even, from the looks of it, replace your Twitter icon with your new file.</p>\n<p>If you haven\'t seen the earlier version of this application, its still available from the AIR Marketplace <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&amp;offeringid=10313&amp;marketplaceid=1" target="_blank">[link]</a>, and the newer version, Icon Generator Pro is available from <a href="http://icon-generator.net/" target="_blank">http://icon-generator.net/</a>.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Link: Icon Generator Pro",date:"May 12, 2010",tags:["air-marketplace","icons"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
