Usually external assets like Pixel Bender are available in the source files in a standalone format, and that\'s all you really need to incorporate those filters into your own projects.\n<p>Well, almost.  The two types of source files you\'re likely to get are .pbj or .pbk.  If you get .pbk files you can use them directly in the Pixel Bender Toolkit.  If you get .pbj files - check out this <a href="http://blog.minim.pl/?p=32" target="_blank">blog post</a> and <a href="http://blog.minim.pl/PBJtoAS/" target="_blank">Flex application</a> which can help you get started converting those files into usable Actionscript classes.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"How to: poach Pixel Bender filters.",date:"February 12, 2009",tags:["pixel-bender"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
