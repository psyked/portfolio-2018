That's because they make use of XHTML and namespaces. Sure, mixing XHTML and HTML5 together on a single page works just fine for the end-user, but when it comes to validating your pages on the W3C, it just won't work.</p>\n<p>What's the 'solution'? Why, hacking it, of course. Take the code for those elements out of the source, and embed it with JavaScript instead. Â And it doesn't have to be complex either - you can use inline JavaScript code.</p>\n<p>Wrap your button embed HTML in a <script> tag, add a CDATA block, and encompass it in a <code>document.write()</code> function, and you're done.</p>\n<p>So this code:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1356698.js\"></script>\n<p>Becomes this code:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1356694.js\"></script>\n<p>Of course, this being a hack, I can't really speak for this being good practice, but it works. Evaluating the pitfalls will come later, I'm sure!</p>",frontmatter:{title:'Hacking Facebook "Like" buttons for W3C Validation in HTML5',date:"November 11, 2011",tags:["facebook","html","html5","hacks","validation"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/fotb2011-highlight-1/",tags:["flash"],title:"FOTB2011 Highlight #1: HiSlope",image:null,date:"2011-09-15T19:43:55.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/improving-your-website-with-nibbler/",tags:["external-links","html","nibbler","validation"],title:"Improving your website with Nibbler",image:null,date:"2011-11-14T07:30:29.000Z"}}}}}});
