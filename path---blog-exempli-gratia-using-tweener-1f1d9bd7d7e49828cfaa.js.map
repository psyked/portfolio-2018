You add tweens with the Tweener.addTween(); function, which takes two attributes: the target, and an object containing the tween variables.  The <a href=\\\"http://hosted.zeh.com.br/tweener/docs/en-us/\\\">Tweener documentation</a> lists all of the possible parameters, but the basic ones you will need are <strong>time</strong>, <strong>transition</strong> and the <strong>attribute</strong> you're manipulating.
