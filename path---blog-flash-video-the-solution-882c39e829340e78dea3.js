Sure, there\'s a few out there, but not many that are decent.  I have used <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://www.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/FLV-Player-Screenshot-27852.html" target="_blank">FLV Player 1.3.3</a>, but it\'s not up to much when you\'re trying to preview or edit files.  Adobe\'s own <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/productinfo/encoder/" target="_blank">Flash Video Encoder</a> is worse than id\'ve thought it would be.  You can only encode once, and you can\'t decode, edit or view the files afterwards.  We have been promised the arrival of the <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Media_Player" target="_blank">Adobe Media Player</a>, but that\'s no comfort until it actually materializes.</p>\n<p>By far the best solution for playing Flash Video so far is the <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://www.richapps.de/?p=48" target="_blank">RichFLV 2</a> - an Apollo-based desktop FLV Player.  It\'s in Alpha stage of production,  (isn\'t everything nowadays?) but it\'s already looking far more promising than any competition.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/content/images/2007/05/adobe-apollo.png" alt="Adobe Apollo CS3" /></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Flash Video - the Solution?",date:"May 28, 2007",tags:["flash","air","tools"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
