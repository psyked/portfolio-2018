When the project started, I was having to look up things like &apos;functions&apos; on Google to see what all those forums were talking about.  This was definately my biggest step into the murky waters of flash programming, and one I&apos;m pleased I took.  1189 lines of Actionscript later, and I had my (considerably adjusted from the inital spec) prototype.\n<p>The topic, by the way, was independent studies - and I used this to develop my own vision of a player-interactable, AI-driven, tron-esque, cell-based life simulation.  It\'s buggy I know, and it\'s current state is what I wouldn\'t consider finished - but this project was pushing the limits of my flash skills at the time.  Now I\'ve dug out my old source files, I\'m looking forward to seeing what I can do with this concept now that I know so much more about programming!</p>\n<p>Anyway, here\'s the flash file...</p>\n<p>[kml_flashembed movie="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/SUBMITTAL-PROTOTYPE.swf" height="450" width="750" /]</p>\n<p>Don\'t worry if you can\'t understand what\'s going on - aside from the interesting AI behaviours, there\'s not too many clear goals.  It\'s for show, not really for a viable game model!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"I found one of my old uni projects...",date:"February 04, 2008",tags:["actionscript","flash","university-projects"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
