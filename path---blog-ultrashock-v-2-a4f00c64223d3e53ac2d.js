The site itself is pretty impressive you know. It\'s mostly full browser flash, and a few of the interface elements gives away that it\'s based in Flex, presumably with some very custom UI elements.</p>\n<p>There\'s the whole <a href="http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/" title="Open link in a new window">SWFAddress</a> deeplinking going on, Flash and Flex integration, and a very seamless transition to non-Flash elements, like the Forums and Wordpress powered blog. If you\'re looking for a showcase Flex site, here\'s a goodie. <a href="http://www.thefwa.com/?app=winners&#x26;id=6489" title="Open link in a new window">FWA</a> thinks so too.</p>\n<p>What\'s more they\'re in the trade of selling content, kinda like FlashDen - which is cool.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Ultrashock v2",date:"April 24, 2008",tags:["external-links","flash","flex","showcase"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
