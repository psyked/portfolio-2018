Sure, there\'s a few out there, but not many that are decent. I have used <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/FLV-Player-Screenshot-27852.html" title="Open this link in a new window.">FLV Player 1.3.3</a>, but it\'s not up to much when you\'re trying to preview or edit files. Adobe\'s own <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/productinfo/encoder/" title="Open this link in a new window.">Flash Video Encoder</a> is worse than id\'ve thought it would be. You can only encode once, and you can\'t decode, edit or view the files afterwards. We have been promised the arrival of the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Media_Player" title="Open this link in a new window.">Adobe Media Player</a>, but that\'s no comfort until it actually materializes.</p>\n<p>By far the best solution for playing Flash Video so far is the <a href="http://www.richapps.de/?p=48" title="Open this link in a new window.">RichFLV 2</a> - an Apollo-based desktop FLV Player. It\'s in Alpha stage of production, (isn\'t everything nowadays?) but it\'s already looking far more promising than any competition.</p>\n<p><img src="/content/images/2007/05/adobe-apollo.png" alt="Adobe Apollo CS3"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Flash Video - the Solution?",date:"May 28, 2007",tags:["flash","air","tools"],url:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/flash-player-set-to-include-hd-video/",tags:["flash","adobe","beta","hd_video"],title:"Flash Player - set to include HD Video",image:null,date:"2007-08-23T21:34:08.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/flash-player-security-update/",tags:["flash","javascript","externalinterface","geturl"],title:"09/04/08 Flash Player security update",image:null,date:"2008-03-16T19:59:47.000Z"}}}}}});
