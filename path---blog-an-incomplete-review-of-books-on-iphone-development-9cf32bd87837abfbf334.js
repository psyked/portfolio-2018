(Like the title says, an incomplete review)</p>\n<h2>...</h2>\n<p>Seems like a lot of this iPhone stuff is being purposefully obtuse about explaining things in simple terms.  The Apple documentation is thorough to the point of being anal, but leaves you with gaps about the relationships between concepts, and this follows through into the books I've read so far.  Maybe I'm just spoilt by the Flash Platform community and bloggers taking the time to explain things in simple terms!</p>\n<h3>One thing that has helped me understand iPhone development:</h3>\n<p>Surprisingly after buying all those books, the thing that's helped me understand the process the most is a blog post or two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://twilloapp.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-embed-navigation-controller.html\">How to embed a navigation controller inside a tab bar controller</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm sure the books helped some, perhaps got me to the point where I could understand what I was following in this blog post - but this explained with small paragraphs and images what the books have been trying to describe with pages of text. Kudos, <strong>b00giZm</strong>.</p>\n<p>And if anyone can recommend any other iPhone development books, I'm all ears...</p>",frontmatter:{title:"An incomplete review of books on iPhone Development.",date:"May 26, 2010",tags:["external-links","books","iphone"],url:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/as3-language-reference-in-an-air-application/",tags:["air"],title:"AS3 Language Reference in an AIR application",image:null,date:"2008-12-10T13:27:40.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/apollo-takes-to-the-air/",tags:["adobe","air","open-source"],title:"Apollo takes to the .air",image:null,date:"2007-06-26T21:41:55.000Z"}}}}}});
