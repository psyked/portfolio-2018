You can then watch the video for up to 30 days after you've downloaded it online or offline. They've used a Flash Media Rights Management Server to DRM-Protect content so you shouldn't be able to get to the video file. Pretty cool stuff.</p>\n<p>You can find more info here: <a href=\"http://www.ashorten.com/2008/12/19/bbc-launches-iplayer-desktop-on-adobe-air/\">http://www.ashorten.com/2008/12/19/bbc-launches-iplayer-desktop-on-adobe-air/</a></p>",frontmatter:{title:"BBC Releases an AIR version of the iPlayer",date:"December 22, 2008",tags:["air-applications","bbc"],url:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/bbc-sports-air-application-removes-its-offensive-language/",tags:["air","auto-updating","bbc","olympics","swearing"],title:"BBC Sports' AIR Application removes its offensive language",image:null,date:"2008-08-05T15:39:07.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/back-to-school-top-10-adobe-flex-and-air-applications-for-students/",tags:["flex","air","students"],title:"Back to School: Top 10 Adobe Flex and AIR applications for students",image:null,date:"2008-09-18T09:30:47.000Z"}}}}}});
