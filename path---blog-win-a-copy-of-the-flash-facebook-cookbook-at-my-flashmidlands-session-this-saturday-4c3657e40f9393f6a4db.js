Starting where the Flash Facebook Cookbook starts we’ll cover relevant background theory on how the APIs work – how to authenticate applications and obtain access tokens, how to request data from, and send data to Facebook, and how to obtain Extended Permissions from the user.</p>\n<p>I’ll be using Flash Builder and the Flex framework to show examples of how everything works in practice, and then we’ll have a look at the possibilities and limitations of what you can do with Flash and Facebook.</p>\n<p>If that sounds fun, and you\'re in the UK, and you can get to Warwick on Saturday, join me! </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\'m terrified enough by the idea of giving a presentation, so more people can\'t hurt!</p>\n</blockquote>',frontmatter:{title:"Win a copy of the Flash Facebook Cookbook, at my FlashMidlands session, this Saturday.",date:"November 15, 2011",tags:["the-flash-facebook-cookbook"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
