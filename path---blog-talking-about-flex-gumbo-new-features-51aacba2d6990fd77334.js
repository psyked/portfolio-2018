Network monitor, as you might expect, monitors and reports the network connections that your Flex project makes and records the data sent and recieved so you can get a better picture of what\'s going on.\n<h2>What they didn\'t get right...</h2>\n<h3>Templates</h3>\nTemplates, templates templates.  Project templates are being introduced, but so far it just seems like you can customise the default template - not actually create and manage multiple project templates.  Dropped the ball there - multiple custom project templates could have been such a great feature...\n<h2>Flex 4 resources</h2>\nFlex 4 is due for release in the latter quarter of this year.  Nothing specific, of course.  You can get hold of a work-in-progress version of Flex 4 from the Adobe opensource site, and find a few more resources here;\n<ul>\n\t<li>Adobe Opensource - Flex SDK: <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Gumbo" target="_blank">http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Gumbo</a></li>\n\t<li>Flex Gumbo Language reference: <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/gumbo/langref/" target="_blank">http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/gumbo/langref/</a></li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{title:"Talking about: Flex Gumbo - new features",date:"April 06, 2009",tags:["flex","flex-4","gumbo"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
