That is after all, what I have this site for.

In theory, you'd just be adding a listing of all posts within a category, for each tag. It's certainly not a bad idea - if implimented correctly - so does that mean it is, in fact, a good idea? If we could get the listings into a condensed AJAX-ish dropdown, similar to the behaviour of the 'Share this' plugin, we might even be on to a winner...</p>",frontmatter:{title:"A different approach to tagging?",date:"February 03, 2008",tags:["external-links","tagging","wordpress-plugins"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/xslt-and-rss-feeds/",tags:["html","rss-tag","xsl","xslt"],title:"XSLT and RSS feeds.",image:null,date:"2008-01-30T23:09:58.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/i-found-one-of-my-old-uni-projects/",tags:["actionscript","flash","university-projects"],title:"I found one of my old uni projects...",image:null,date:"2008-02-04T23:01:04.000Z"}}}}}});
