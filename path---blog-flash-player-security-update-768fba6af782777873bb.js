I am of course, referrring to the <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/adobe/flash/sifr-links-not-working.htm" title="Open link in a new window">issues that were encountered with sIFR Flash links</a>, caused by the Flash Player version 9.0.115 (kudos to <a href="http://novemberborn.net/">Mark Wubben</a> for explaining this to me) and also in more general terms to the introduction of a rigid security model with Flash Player 8.</p>\n<p>While we\'re always doing our best to code in the most secure, efficent ways - like for example, using the <strong>ExternalInterface</strong> class as opposed to communicating with javascript via <strong>getURL(javascript:)</strong> <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/actionscript/actionscript-geturl-vs-externalinterface-when-why.htm">[1]</a> - there\'s situations where these techniques weren\'t available at the time they were written, and these are going to be broken by the update.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player9_security_update.html#javascript" title="Open link in a new window">Adobe\'s solution?</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your content is using "javascript:" within the prohibited networking APIs, you will need to rewrite your content. Developers are encouraged to use the ExternalInterface class for JavaScript-to-ActionScript communication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rewrite your code?! That like, must be breaking some unwritten rule of versioning, surely? Files published under a different version shouldn\'t be mercy to the whims of newer players - otherwise, what\'s the point?</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.unitzeroone.com/blog/2008/03/11/developers-beware-upcoming-flash-security-update-april-2008/" title="Open link in a new window">UnitZeroOne</a> for their article which tipped me off.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"09/04/08 Flash Player security update",date:"March 16, 2008",tags:["flash","javascript","externalinterface","geturl"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/sifr-links-not-working/",tags:["flash"],title:"sIFR links not working?",date:"2008-03-07T21:30:24.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/custom-character-set-embedding-in-flash/",tags:["flash","fonts"],title:"Custom character-set embedding in Flash",date:"2008-03-25T22:13:11.000Z"}}}}}});
