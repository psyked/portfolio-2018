It requires Flash Player version 8 or above, and uses the ColourTransformationMatrix and some clever jiggery-pokery to adjust the RGBA channels of your MovieClips.  In short, it\'s sweet - and fills a gap in the built-in flash filter classes.</p>\n<p>Have a look at this flash movie (below) to see the end result, all generated from the same MovieClip.</p>\n<p>[kml_flashembed movie="http://www.psyked.co.uk/downloads/SaturationManagerTest.swf" height="365" width="470" fversion="8" wmode="transparent" menu="false" /]</p>\n<p>Now, before I go much further, I should point out that the functions that make this possible are down to <a href="http://www.senocular.com/flash/source.php?id=0.169" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">senocular</a>, whose equally awesome code this is based on.  All I really did was figure out a way to turn it into an ActionScript 2.0 Class.  -  Technically it doesn\'t even need to be in a class - but it just makes things easier.</p>\n<h3>Using this Class</h3>\nFirstly, you\'re going to want to <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/SaturationManager.zip" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">download the source files</a>.  It\'s as basic as it comes - using it \'out-the-box\' requires that you take the \'mmt\' folder, and paste it into the same directory as your .fla file.  And then, by typing;\n<p><code>mmt.SaturationManager.setSaturation(your<em>movieclip, the</em>saturation);</code></p>\n<p>You\'ll be able to modify the colour saturation of the MovieClip.   "<code>your<em>movieclip</code>" is obviously a reference to the MovieClip, and "<code>the</em>saturation</code>" is a value from 0 (No Colour) to 100 (Normal Colour).  You can apply values beyond 0 and 100, and oversaturate the colours.  In our example (above) the [1<sup>st</sup> on the left, bottom row] MovieClip is oversaturated, at 150%.</p>\n<h3>Downloads</h3>\n<a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/SaturationManager.zip">Download the source files, containing example .fla and .as files</a> [ZIP, 488KB]\n<a href="/downloads/SaturationManager.as">Download only the .as file</a> [ActionScript File, 1KB]',frontmatter:{title:"MovieClip Saturation Class - ActionScript 2",date:"September 04, 2007",tags:["actionscript","flash","resources"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
