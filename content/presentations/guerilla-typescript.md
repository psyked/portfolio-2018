Think want to use TypeScript, but for one reason or another youâ€™re not ready to make the leap into using .ts files? What is TypeScript anyway? How could it help us make better code or change our development experience? How exactly is it different from normal Javascript, and is there a middle ground to be had with TypeScript that never leaves the safety of Javascript? All of this will hopefully be answered!
