It's finally happened. My tithe to Apple has been paid, and my iPhone has arrived on my desk.

I'm still an Flash Platform developer of course, this isn't a career change - it's a broadening of horizons.  I anticipate much cursing and headscratching is in store for the next few months though.  Here we go, should be 'fun'.
