Print Designers have it easy, you know. They get things like Pantone Books, and well, things like that. Time to even the score? I think so, and obviously so does [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com "Open adobe's website in a new window").

Until recently, I'd touted [ColorJack](http://www.colorjack.com/ "Open ColorJack's website in a new window") as the best place to gen-up on colour theory and match colours, and it's still pretty good. But [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com "Open Kuler in a new window"), from [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com "Open Adobe Labs in a new window"), is awesome for matching up colour schemes. Even better than that, you can save your schemes and share them with others. If you're stuck for inspiration, take it from someone else's scheme. If you need a good match, you can use [Kuler's tools](http://kuler.adobe.com "Open Kuler in a new window") to pick a theoretical partner.

Go ahead, [check it out](http://kuler.adobe.com "Open Kuler in a new window").
