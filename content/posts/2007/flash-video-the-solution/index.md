Working with a lot of Flash video (.flv) I'm acutely aware of the lack in decent, standalone FLV Players. Sure, there's a few out there, but not many that are decent. I have used [FLV Player 1.3.3](http://www.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/FLV-Player-Screenshot-27852.html 'Open this link in a new window.'), but it's not up to much when you're trying to preview or edit files. Adobe's own [Flash Video Encoder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/productinfo/encoder/ 'Open this link in a new window.') is worse than id've thought it would be. You can only encode once, and you can't decode, edit or view the files afterwards. We have been promised the arrival of the [Adobe Media Player](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Media_Player 'Open this link in a new window.'), but that's no comfort until it actually materializes.

By far the best solution for playing Flash Video so far is the [RichFLV 2](http://www.richapps.de/?p=48 'Open this link in a new window.') \- an Apollo-based desktop FLV Player. It's in Alpha stage of production, (isn't everything nowadays?) but it's already looking far more promising than any competition.
