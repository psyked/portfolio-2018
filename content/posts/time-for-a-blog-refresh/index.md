Blogsessive has a really nice post on "20 Free Corporate Wordpress Themes", over at [http://blogsessive.com/blogging-tips/20-corporate-free-wordpress-themes/](http://blogsessive.com/blogging-tips/20-corporate-free-wordpress-themes/).

A couple of my favourates are the **Modern** and **Corporate Sandbox**, but **Basic**, **Deadwood Lite** and **Natural Power** also have a nice flair.  It's been a while since my last theme update, and a few bugs have been cropping up so I thought it might be a good time to update the theme - maybe even make it something for the new year!
