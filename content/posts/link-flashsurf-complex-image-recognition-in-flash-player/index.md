FlashSURF is an image recognition library for Flash, distinguishable from other projects like the QR code and face recognition libraries by the fact that it’s just too damn clever. It’s a full colour, high resolution image recognition library that works in real time off a video feed (such as a webcam).  And it comes as a compiled SWC for flash so it’s ready to be used now.  You should at least check out [Eugene's post](http://blog.inspirit.ru/?p=386) on the stuff to get an idea of it's capabilities.

Seriously, some people are just too damn clever.
