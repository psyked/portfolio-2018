If you don't know what ORM is read the next paragraph, and it might help.  If you do, skip to the links below to learn a little more about how you can make ORM work with AIR and SQLite.

ORM stands for [Object Relational Mapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), in basic terms the concept of representing your tables-based data as more familiar objects and classes.
