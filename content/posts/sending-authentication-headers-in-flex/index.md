Here's a few useful posts concerning Authentication of HTTP requests.

In Flex (with HTTP Service class): [http://www.geekzguru.net/howto-add-basic-authentication-header-to-httpservice/](http://www.geekzguru.net/howto-add-basic-authentication-header-to-httpservice/)

In Flex (with URLLoader class): [http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/flash\_and\_actionscript/ http_authentica.php](http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/flash_and_actionscript/http_authentica.php)

and in general, using Flash to interface with RESTful APIs: [http://dynamicflash.com/2008/11/ the-trouble-with-flash-and-rest/comment-page-1/](http://dynamicflash.com/2008/11/the-trouble-with-flash-and-rest/comment-page-1/)

All very interesting to me currently - sometime I'll get down to writing a bit more about what I'm doing...
