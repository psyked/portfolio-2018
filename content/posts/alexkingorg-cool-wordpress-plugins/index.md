If you're sitting around, wondering what would make your Wordpress just that little bit more awesome, be sure to check out the [Wordpress Plugins section of alexking.org](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress "Open link in a new window").  What can I say?  The plugins are all geared towards adding that little extra bit of style _and_ usability to your site.  I'm going to be incorporating them into Psyked over the next week or so - so I'd certainly reccomend them!
