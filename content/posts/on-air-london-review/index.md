Well, despite coming down with a killer headache 1/2 way through the event, I thoroughly enjoyed the London leg of the on AIR tour. All the guys from Adobe and \[most of\] the 'guest speakers' were really interesting. Toying around with AIR before the event helped understand things a little better, but looking up stuff on the 'net just doesn't compare to having it demonstrated on the tour. Like the [worlds smallest video player](http://www.webkitchen.be/2008/03/07/play-video-in-your-dock-with-air/ 'Open link in a new window').

I think you can tell something's good if the event-hype subsides and you still find yourself dreaming up ideas.

I believe that the whole day was being recorded - there was certainly some notices up about it, and a DV-Cam setup at the back. Doesn't appear to be online yet, though if I spot it, i'll let you know.
