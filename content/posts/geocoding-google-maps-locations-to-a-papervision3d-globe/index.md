In the June 2008 edition of the Adobe Edge newsletter, there was an article ["Learn how to geocode with Papervision3D and Adobe Flex"](http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/edge/june2008/articles/article2/index.html).  You can also [view the demo directly](http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/edge/june2008/articles/article2/download/GeoGlobe.html).

Pretty awesome, eh?  All of the sample source code is available from the Adobe Edge page.
