At this point, we’ve [prototyped our idea](https://medium.com/@psyked/pok%C3%A9project-dev-diary-day-one-8a77a252bf0a), [improved it visually](https://medium.com/@psyked/pokeproject-dev-diary-day-two-a6019e6cf0f0), [sorted out our own store of data](https://medium.com/@psyked/pok%C3%A9project-dev-diary-day-three-31afdf3e1302), and now it’s time to — finally — go live.

In the spirit of [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), I’m not going to wait for every one of my crazy ideas to be finished before opening it up to the whole world — we’re going to go live with an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) and soft launch our way to world domination.

In a fit of impulsiveness (and on the wrong side of midnight) I’ve decided to stick with the working project name and purchase it as a domain name: [pokeproject.co.uk](https://www.pokeproject.co.uk), so now we’ve even got a real domain, and we can stop redirecting our beta testers to a subdomain.

#### Advertising

One of my sly objectives with this project was to also try out advertising, using a service like [Google Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/) to make some money out of it all. I’ve never added adverts to any of my side projects before — hating adverts as much as the next internet user — but this time I’ll selectively ignore my own disapproval of advertising to give some money-making opportunity a shot, even if it is to see for myself just how fantastically unprofitable it really is!

I’ve made a little space down the bottom of the screen for adverts to appear, signed up to Google Adsense, created a few tags and dropped them into the design. We’ll see how well that goes as time progresses.
