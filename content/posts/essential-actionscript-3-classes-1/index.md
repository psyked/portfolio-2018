[BiteArray.org](http://www.bytearray.org/?page_id=82 "Open link in a new window") has a little collection of several ActionScript 3 Classes that would feel right at home in your core libraries.  There's a [JPEG encoder](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=90 "Open link in a new window"), [PDF generator](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=107 "Open link in a new window"), [Zip file generator](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=105 "Open link in a new window") and even a class for [gesture recognition](http://www.bytearray.org/?p=91 "Open link in a new window"), and many more besides.  It's worth a look.
