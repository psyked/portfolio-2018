I wrote a post a while back detailing where it can be found for both OSX and Windows:\n[http://www.jonnymac.com/blog/2008/11/04/offline-help-and-language-reference-location-in-flash-cs4/](http://www.jonnymac.com/blog/2008/11/04/offline-help-and-language-reference-location-in-flash-cs4/)\n\nThe difference is that CS4 automatically tries to send you to the online copy first. You can also access the local copy by telling Flash to “keep you offline”:\n\nGo to Window > Extensions > Connections. In the panel that pops up, click the arrow at the top-right and select “Offline options”. From there you can check the box for “Keep me offline”. It will then always default to using the offline help. However, it may also prevent you from using any other panels which call out to the internet, such as Kuler.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nJon MacDonald on December 9th, 2008 at 12:30 pm\n</code></pre>',frontmatter:{title:"How to make the Flash CS4 Help and Language reference available offline.",date:"December 10, 2008",tags:["flash"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/as3-language-reference-in-an-air-application/",tags:["air"],title:"AS3 Language Reference in an AIR application",date:"2008-12-10T13:27:40.000Z",description:null,image:null}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/using-the-flvplayback-component-in-flex/",tags:["flash","flex"],title:"Using the FLVPlayback component in Flex",date:"2008-12-16T08:45:50.000Z",description:null,image:null}}}}}});
