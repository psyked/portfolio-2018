But why should we insist so strongly that everyone uses it?</p>\n<p>Having a decent source control system in place allows multiple developers to work in parallel on the same project and project files, gives each of them access to an annotated code history, and the ability to create or combine parallel sets of changes from others into a final, ‘working version’ of that code.</p>\n<p>Using source control in this manner also makes the automation of testing and deployment processes possible, improving our development efficiency.</p>\n<p>The final, and most <strong>business critical</strong> point is that, using a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) in conjunction with a service like <em>Bitbucket</em> makes us ‘Fireproof’ in the sense that — if our offices were to suffer an overnight calamity — we still have multiple intact copies of the source code, from which the entire project could be restored.</p>\n<p>This final ‘business critical’ point is where our rule originates.
