its funny really, you feel like you've been here for ages based on what you've seen, but then you step back and realise it's only Monday.</p>\n<p>John Davis' Keynote was a good introduction - teasing us with the features of Flash Player 10 - and setting us up for Wednesdays' session on \"The Ying and Yang of Flash\".  I missed the mornings session on <a href=\"http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2194\">“Mash-up widgets with Adobe AIR”</a>, but caught Brendan Halls' <a href=\"http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2112\">“Brilliant Ideas that I’ve blatantly stolen”</a> - which had some really interesting ideas - and saw Thermo in all its prerelease glory at Mark Anders' <a href=\"http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2174\">\"A Preview of Flex 4 and 'Thermo'\"</a></p>\n<p>Really interesting however was the session by Erik Natzke on <a href=\"http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2101\">\"Beyond the Knowledge: The Art of Play\"</a> where he showed how he's developed Flash into and art tool, and uses it to create works of art like the one above and those on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/natzke/\">Flickr</a> and <a href=\"http://jot.eriknatzke.com/\">his blog</a>.  Inspiring stuff.</p>\n<p>As for the social side of things, Mark met '<a href=\"http://natejc.com/blog/\">the guy who wrote Tweener</a>' although I missed him.</p>\n<p>Beer and sessions are another inspired idea for networking, and we also met Tim and Kyle from <a href=\"http://www.teamcooper.co.uk/\">Team Cooper Ltd.</a>.</p>\n<p>On Tueday we've got sessions by Lee Brimelow and Grant Skinner so no doubt they'll be awesome.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"FOTB: Day One","date":"September 30, 2008","tags":["flash","conferences","flash-on-the-beach","fotb"],"url":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/1b9c2b1e0e52fa71e5a49ba48c91ee78/32ee9/fotb1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1b9c2b1e0e52fa71e5a49ba48c91ee78/10bdc/fotb1.jpg 158w,\n/static/1b9c2b1e0e52fa71e5a49ba48c91ee78/f4ab0/fotb1.jpg 315w,\n/static/1b9c2b1e0e52fa71e5a49ba48c91ee78/32ee9/fotb1.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#ED9E12","darkVibrant":"#75490D","lightVibrant":"#EFD453","muted":"#A19264","darkMuted":"#295E51","lightMuted":"#A2BEA7"}},"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/fotb-day-zero/","tags":["flash","conferences","flash-on-the-beach","ftob"],"title":"FOTB: Day Zero","date":"2008-09-28T19:57:07.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/32ee9/fotb0.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/10bdc/fotb0.jpg 158w,\n/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/f4ab0/fotb0.jpg 315w,\n/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/32ee9/fotb0.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/fish-eye-menu-in-actionscript-20/","tags":["flash","actionscript"],"title":"Fish Eye Menu in ActionScript 2.0","date":"2008-10-12T13:01:05.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
