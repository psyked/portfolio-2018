This poses a minor problem because if you just try to whack HTML from your XML into a dynamic textbox, the formatting won't work properly and you'll get the characters &#x3C; and > appearing, along with the HTML formatting commands - because the &#x3C; and > characters are encoded.</p>\n<p>Annoying yes, easy to fix - yes.</p>\n<p>Find and replace is your ally here - or as near as we can easily get;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>xmlcdata<strong>.split('&#x3C;').join('>').split('>').join('>')</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Run that on your string of text before you put it into your textbox and you're good to go!</p>\n<h3>Quirks?</h3>\n<p>What you also might find is that HTML formatted textboxes could actually display the contents of a CDATA node without the CDATA node being correctly accessed.  If you access the node with the childNodes property, and put that into your textbox, then the contents will display, but not with HTML formatting.</p>\n<p>What Flash is actually doing is grabbing the CDATA element (and everything inside it).  Assigning this variable to a textbox <em>should fail</em>, but in actual fact it works - to a certain extent.  It seems like the HTML formatting of the textbox allows it to parse the XML element and then consiquently display the content within.  The problem then comes when you want to manipulate this data - the contents of the textboxes' text is not actually a string, but an XMLNode.  Weird, huh?</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"ActionScript 2 - XML CDATA returns undefined, or htmlText doesn't work!","date":"September 17, 2008","tags":["actionscript","flash","cdata","quirks","xml"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/google-analytics-unveiled/","tags":["apis","google-analytics","google-code"],"title":"Google Analytics — Unveiled.","date":"2008-09-12T10:00:10.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/fotb-day-zero/","tags":["flash","conferences","flash-on-the-beach","ftob"],"title":"FOTB: Day Zero","date":"2008-09-28T19:57:07.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEAgP/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHCqRcJ3Ef/xAAZEAEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIREjH/2gAIAQEAAQUC4nLEyUBjUy3v/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABES/9oACAEDAQE/AYy//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABES/9oACAECAQE/Aa0//8QAGRAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEBAhAh/9oACAEBAAY/AnUUZ0Wf/8QAGhABAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIXFBUf/aAAgBAQABPyFoYkS9uSxTZ2MtBh2monPyf//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQQ9//xAAWEQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBH/2gAIAQMBAT8Qgp//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAgBAgEBPxCEP//EAB4QAQEAAgAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVFhcYGx/9oACAEBAAE/EBI7msfuAcsy78feJAToI47ulSmAcAuzy4ZVTQu4Z//Z","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/32ee9/fotb0.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/10bdc/fotb0.jpg 158w,\n/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/f4ab0/fotb0.jpg 315w,\n/static/7f1ff339d13776582a828788ab121440/32ee9/fotb0.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}}}}
