Amongst them are sites like <a href=\"http://www.sxc.hu\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">Stock.xchng</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">flickr</a>. It even utilizes <a href=\"http://www.opensearch.org\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">OpenSearch</a> to make it even more useful.</p>\n<p>The downside of using EveryStockPhoto however, is that you can't instantly be sure of the liscensing permissions of the images, and you have to look into it yourself, which can take a little longer than simply searching on places like Stock.xchng. Plus, the search results are often full of amateur photography results pulled from flickr (most of which are tagged in some stupid way for a stock repository) But, where there's volume, there's more of a chance that your obscure search results will dredge up something.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"EveryStockPhoto","date":"June 04, 2007","tags":["external-links","resources","stock-images"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/stock-exchange/","tags":["external-links","resources","stock-images"],"title":"Stock Exchange","date":"2007-06-03T14:44:02.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/fdc3101748c54783d65372c5dd62bbbd/9dc27/710871_curiosity.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fdc3101748c54783d65372c5dd62bbbd/426bb/710871_curiosity.jpg 158w,\n/static/fdc3101748c54783d65372c5dd62bbbd/9dc27/710871_curiosity.jpg 300w","sizes":"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"}}}}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/flash-16bit-colour-blendmodes-and-cacheasbitmap-a-recipie-for-disaster/","tags":["actionscript","flash"],"title":"Flash, 16bit colour, blendModes and cacheAsBitmap.
