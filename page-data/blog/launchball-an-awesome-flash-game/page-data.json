Once I started playing the game I was staggered by how fully realised it is - no skimping on the programming here, we're talking realistic physics and complete freedom, thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.cove.org/flade/\">Flade</a> Actionscript dynamics / physics engine. (Launchball is AS2 - but incidently Flade is now called the <a href=\"http://www.cove.org/ape/\">APE</a> and is available in AS3 format).</p>\n<p>And when everything just works, you start to get far more creative. Most Flash games are tasks, challenges, but Launchball seems so much more like an environment (with a goal, of course). It's beyond your average Flash game and into the realms of something I'd expect from a proper games console.  No wonder it picked up a few awards!</p>\n<p>There's an awful lot of fun to be had with Launchball, and if you've got friends, there's also more to the game than the standard few levels - there's a whole host of features for creating and sharing your own levels. I was also interested to see that, although the game doesn't have any <em>real</em> integration with sites like Facebook (all the game sharing is done via the good old e-mail &#x26; account method) there <em>is</em> a group devoted to the game.
