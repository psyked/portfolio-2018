News sources all over the place were raving about it - which just shows you the what a link on the homepage of Google can do.</p>\n<p>As for Chrome itself, there's a few things I really like about it - like no total-browser crashes, better performance, its own task manager and the fact that it uses the Webkit rendering engine - which is the same as the one used by the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR).  Oh, and the fact that I don't have to endure repeated crashes all day long - like I do with Internet Explorer and Firefox.</p>\n<p>The design something a little different, with a few new takes on old ideas, like tabs and the browser status bar.  But what's really quite interesting is the underlying architecture and the way that they've implimented the javascript - something called jittered JavaScript or JavaVM.  Whatever the hell that is, it apparently means its really fast (<a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10034365-92.html?part=rss&#x26;subj=news&#x26;tag=2547-1_3-0-5\">read an article about it on cNet</a>) - and hopefully it also means that old annoyances like javascript locking up the browser will be less of an issue!</p>\n<h2>Can Chrome replace browser x?</h2>\n<p><strong>Not right now</strong> - I don't think.  It's certainly fast and pretty, but for me there's a good deal of things it can't do that other browsers can do.  Like RSS feeds, or the development plugins that I use at work.  These things might be 3rd party extensions to my other browser, but at least they're there. As soon as I can however, I can see myself switching default browsers.</p>\n<p>Of course, Chrome is still in Beta so it'll be exciting to see it when it goes Gold...</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Chrome is kinda awesome...","date":"September 10, 2008","tags":["javascript","chrome","google","webkit"],"url":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEDBAX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB24LKhjK//8QAGBAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhABA0H/2gAIAQEAAQUCysiNwv/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQMBAT8BP//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABgQAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABICEi/9oACAEBAAY/AjSqP//EABsQAQEAAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExUYGh/9oACAEBAAE/IconyecHCO5te8Gb/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABDrD//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQ/9oACAEDAQE/ECf/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABERD/2gAIAQIBAT8QRpM//8QAHBABAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUWGB/9oACAEBAAE/EEBFS0HNRtIs1KfsoFCAmyeMO1nF5YFl7Z//2Q==","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/0199f945f8ffe108f6acfda66eb73a1c/32ee9/google-chrome.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0199f945f8ffe108f6acfda66eb73a1c/10bdc/google-chrome.jpg 158w,\n/static/0199f945f8ffe108f6acfda66eb73a1c/f4ab0/google-chrome.jpg 315w,\n/static/0199f945f8ffe108f6acfda66eb73a1c/32ee9/google-chrome.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#F2D827","darkVibrant":"#047CB8","lightVibrant":"#ECD560","muted":"#4D955C","darkMuted":"#49403F","lightMuted":"#D2BF99"}},"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/all-these-physics-games/","tags":["flash","ape","physics-games"],"title":"All these physics games...","date":"2008-08-25T08:00:55.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/google-analytics-unveiled/","tags":["apis","google-analytics","google-code"],"title":"Google Analytics — Unveiled.","date":"2008-09-12T10:00:10.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
