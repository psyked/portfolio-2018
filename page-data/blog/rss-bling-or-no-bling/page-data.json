So long, in fact, that RSS readers are now built into the two major windows browsers, Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2. It's been inbuilt for longer on the Mac, I hear. So, in our busy little 'Web 2.0' designs, why does the staple ingredient of Blogs and Community websites need to be emblazoned in the design? I mean, what's the point?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2007/05/rssbling1.gif\" alt=\"RSS.  Bling or no Bling?\"></p>\n<p>Ok, let's backtrack my thoughts a bit. I was perusing <a href=\"http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/09/twenty-usability-tips-for-your-blog-%e2%80%94-condensed-from-dozens-of-bloggers-experiences/\" title=\"Open this link in a new window.\">this article</a>, which does a roundup of 'Usability Tips' for your Blog. I consider myself a bit of a usability, uh.. well, a bit knowledgable on the subject. <strong>Point #3 is 'Make it easy to subscribe'</strong> talking about RSS and Podcast subscribing;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make it easy to subscribe to your feed by placing an orange RSS button in a highly visible location. Route your feed through Feedburner so you can keep track of your subscribers. You can also offer an e-mail subscription using FeedBurner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree with this, however. If you've got properly set-up links and metadata in your pages, your browser should be able to detect it, like this;</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2007/05/firefoxrss.gif\" alt=\"Firefox RSS Detection\"> <img src=\"/content/images/2007/05/ie7rss.gif\" alt=\"IE7 RSS detection\"></p>\n<p>So there's no real need for a big button, right? I suppose it's down to old understated / overstated design issue. If you want to look bright and shiny and 'Web 2.0' you stick a big RSS button on. That way no-one will miss the opportunity to subscribe. Frankly though, I always read the content before deciding if I might want to subscribe to the RSS. If I do, i'll look for the RSS detection in my browser, which has to handle the process anyway.</p>\n<p>Usability is all about clarity and optimizing the click-process. So don't go overloading your pages with shiny buttons that aren't nessessary, and don't blithely add them because everyone else does. You'll thank me when the backlash arrives.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2007/05/feed.png\" alt=\"RSS Feed\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"RSS.
