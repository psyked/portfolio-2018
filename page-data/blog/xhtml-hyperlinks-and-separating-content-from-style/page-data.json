And often one with little discernable gain. Did you know you can't use target attributes in link tags? Or alignment tags? Ok, so the alignment tags is a non-issue - we can do the same with CSS styles. But how, pray tell, do we achieve the feats we take for granted in HTML - target=\"_blank\" ?</p>\n<p>I've been pointed down the JavaScript road by several people, but I don't quite get how JavaScript is <em>the</em> solution after all, JavaScript made popup blockers what they are today. Nevertheless, here's <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/popuplinks\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">an interesting article from A List Apart</a>. They cover several solutions, most of which are ugly and, well, not a real solution to avoiding the target attribute. The final option they cover however, is just the charm.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/popuplinks\" title=\"Open link in a new window\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 320px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"alistapartcom\"\n        title=\"alistapartcom\"\n        src=\"/static/d72ab66a1181cad05bfe8d5ff24f5781/f562b/alistapartcom.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d72ab66a1181cad05bfe8d5ff24f5781/afcd2/alistapartcom.jpg 300w,\n/static/d72ab66a1181cad05bfe8d5ff24f5781/f562b/alistapartcom.jpg 320w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\"\n      />\n    </span></a></p>\n<h3>So, how does it work?</h3>\n<p>Well, the solution - if you can call it that - is a little more high-brow than the scripts I write from day-to-day, using listeners to hook into the click events of links, kidnap the urlrequest, and process it with JavaScript. The upside - you can leverage JavaScript onto any link, and perform far more complex tasks than the browsers' built-in links. The downside? It's a lot of preparation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"XHTML, Hyperlinks and separating content from style.","date":"October 15, 2007","tags":["html","javascript","hyperlinks","xhtml"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/mastering-photoshop-with-psdtutscom/","tags":["design","external-links","resources"],"title":"Mastering Photoshop with psdtuts.com","date":"2007-10-08T20:55:26.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/externalinterface-not-working-in-firefox/","tags":["actionscript","externalinterface","firefox"],"title":"ExternalInterface not working in Firefox?","date":"2007-10-20T10:31:39.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
