When the project started, I was having to look up things like 'functions' on Google to see what all those forums were talking about. This was definately my biggest step into the murky waters of flash programming, and one I'm pleased I took. 1189 lines of Actionscript later, and I had my (considerably adjusted from the inital spec) prototype.</p>\n<p>The topic, by the way, was independent studies - and I used this to develop my own vision of a player-interactable, AI-driven, tron-esque, cell-based life simulation. It's buggy I know, and it's current state is what I wouldn't consider finished - but this project was pushing the limits of my flash skills at the time. Now I've dug out my old source files, I'm looking forward to seeing what I can do with this concept now that I know so much more about programming!</p>\n<p>Anyway, here's the flash file...</p>\n<p>[kml_flashembed movie=\"<a href=\"http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/SUBMITTAL-PROTOTYPE.swf\">http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/SUBMITTAL-PROTOTYPE.swf</a>\" height=\"450\" width=\"750\" /]</p>\n<p>Don't worry if you can't understand what's going on - aside from the interesting AI behaviours, there's not too many clear goals. It's for show, not really for a viable game model!</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"I found one of my old uni projects...","date":"February 04, 2008","tags":["actionscript","flash","university-projects"],"url":null,"image":{"id":"ab42693a-248d-5889-b232-0bd6b805c881","childImageSharp":{"id":"b86043dc-883d-5ff5-8e17-6bebbaf13b46","sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.0454545454545454,"src":"/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/32fd5/uniproject.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/426bb/uniproject.jpg 158w,\n/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/6544a/uniproject.jpg 315w,\n/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/32fd5/uniproject.jpg 450w","sizes":"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#ACD484","darkVibrant":"#426222","lightVibrant":"#BDDD9D","muted":"#AC6C94","darkMuted":"#5C344C","lightMuted":"#4D7128"}},"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/a-different-approach-to-tagging/","tags":["external-links","tagging","wordpress-plugins"],"title":"A different approach to tagging?","date":"2008-02-03T23:33:12.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/adobe-on-air-comes-to-london/","tags":["adobe","air","conferences"],"title":"Adobe on AIR comes to London...","date":"2008-02-23T15:59:34.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.3333333333333333,"src":"/static/5e6f52f5024c2e528703cf8a37279a24/c01e2/adobecom.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5e6f52f5024c2e528703cf8a37279a24/426bb/adobecom.jpg 158w,\n/static/5e6f52f5024c2e528703cf8a37279a24/6544a/adobecom.jpg 315w,\n/static/5e6f52f5024c2e528703cf8a37279a24/c01e2/adobecom.jpg 320w","sizes":"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"}}}}}}}}
