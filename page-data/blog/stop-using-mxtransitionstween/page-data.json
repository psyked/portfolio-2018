Tweener is a class that replaces Tween, works for Actionscript 2 and Actionscript 3, offers a simpler interface for creating tweens, and has a larger range of easing options to work with.</p>\n<h3><strong>What's wrong with Tween?</strong></h3>\n<p>The Tween class is ok - up to a point. It does what it's supposed to, but once you start trying to integrate it with serious full-on Actionscripting you'll notice a few snags. If you're dynamically creating and removing objects, and then want to dynamically modify the tweens, your tweens will likely go crazy. Start a new Tween and there's very little way you can stop it - even by removing its subject. Stacking Tweens doesn't go down well either - if you create one to move an object left to right, and then mid-animation another to move it back to the left, things go ok until the point that the first animation should finish - whereupon your object will flick back to the finishing position of the first, and then resume the second animation.</p>\n<p>Moreso than that however, is the hassle needed to create an animation with Tween;</p>\n<pre><code>import mx.transitions.Tween;\nimport mx.transitions.easing.*;\n\nvar xPosT:Tween = new Tween(myMovieClip, \"_x\", Bounce.easeOut, 0, Stage.width, 3, true);\nxPosT.onMotionFinished = function() {\n    // movement finished\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3><strong>Why is Tweener better?</strong></h3>\n<p>First up, there's no problems with mixing and matching, no misplaced motion crazyness.  You can apply and reapply tweens to your hearts content, and they all work.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the interface is simpler - you can setup a tween with less lines of code, and you don't have to worry about managing objects to execute functions once your tween has run its course. And a single line of code can handle all of the attributes you want changing for a single object - no separate Tween objects for each attribute, just a single Tweener line for all the attributes (on the same object, under the same time and easing style).</p>\n<pre><code>import caurina.transitions.Tweener;\n\nTweener.addTween(myMovieClip, {_x:Stage.width, time:1, transition:\"linear\", onComplete:onCompleteHandler});\n\nfunction onCompleteHander():Void { // movement finished }; \n</code></pre>\n<p>Thirdly, you don't have to worry about things like start variables - just the end variables.  Which makes far more sense.  In most situations I find I'm only adding the current position of an object as the start variable to Tween.  In Tweener, that's taken as the automatic variable - after all, if you want to set a different position for the object before the tween starts, you just do that on the line above.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there's a invaluable <strong>delay</strong> attribute.  It's a built-in timer for your animations - how useful is that!  Want an animation to start after 10 seconds? Easy - just add 'delay:10' to your Tweener line.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/tweener/\">Download Tweener from its Google Code location</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Stop using mx.transitions.Tween;","date":"July 12, 2008","tags":["flash","actionscript"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/feeling-smart-try-googles-code-jam/","tags":["code-jam","competitions","google"],"title":"Feeling smart?
