 You can however, use the AIR Badge below to install the new version of the application.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"ImageSizer - updated to version 0.3.9!","date":"December 16, 2008","tags":["imagesizer","air-applications"],"url":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/fc4bb9af9af370f5c4fed0c1f23e6213/ca45b/imagesizerupdate.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fc4bb9af9af370f5c4fed0c1f23e6213/5f64f/imagesizerupdate.jpg 158w,\n/static/fc4bb9af9af370f5c4fed0c1f23e6213/981d4/imagesizerupdate.jpg 315w,\n/static/fc4bb9af9af370f5c4fed0c1f23e6213/ca45b/imagesizerupdate.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#DE982E","darkVibrant":"#0B686C","lightVibrant":"#DAC7A7","muted":"#B0926F","darkMuted":"#346464","lightMuted":"#E8E1D5"}},"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/using-the-flvplayback-component-in-flex/","tags":["flash","flex"],"title":"Using the FLVPlayback component in Flex","date":"2008-12-16T08:45:50.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAUA/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAaoGzEr4uX//xAAaEAADAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMABCET/9oACAEBAAEFAqv5TfcKiTik69iig5Hif//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAEDAQE/Aaf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPwGH/8QAHRAAAQQCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECETESIRNRYf/aAAgBAQAGPwLLGRF4r9EfFjp6F1Ro/8QAGhABAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBUf/aAAgBAQABPyE3OPgykSjYwDhjnyChogIITiLLBc//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEJsP/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQ/9oACAEDAQE/EEjJn//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQIf/aAAgBAgEBPxATs//EABwQAQACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQXGBkf/aAAgBAQABPxCseYNTbVwsLcGPWoOpkdrcn2AaEzGDnBSmolo2Gjyf/9k=","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/c25181d089beaa24311d59a90b4e6052/ca45b/flvcomponent.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c25181d089beaa24311d59a90b4e6052/5f64f/flvcomponent.jpg 158w,\n/static/c25181d089beaa24311d59a90b4e6052/981d4/flvcomponent.jpg 315w,\n/static/c25181d089beaa24311d59a90b4e6052/ca45b/flvcomponent.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/ie8-beta-goes-public-and-what-are-those-new-features/","tags":["ie8","internet-explorer","microsoft","opensearch","openservice"],"title":"IE8 Beta goes public - and what are those new features?","date":"2008-12-18T08:46:44.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/805f7b275e0853bfeffc501bfe83ba1e/ca45b/ie8beta.jpg","srcSet":"/static/805f7b275e0853bfeffc501bfe83ba1e/5f64f/ie8beta.jpg 158w,\n/static/805f7b275e0853bfeffc501bfe83ba1e/981d4/ie8beta.jpg 315w,\n/static/805f7b275e0853bfeffc501bfe83ba1e/ca45b/ie8beta.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}}}}
