 Who cares that 44 thousand people have tweeted about the snow falling?  Not me.  What IS good though, is the fact that it's so quick and irreverant.  Full-on blogging takes ages to string together sentances to post.  Ok, you get more meaning across, but it takes longer.  Tweeting something takes a few seconds, and with a liberal smattering of keywords, lots of people read it.</p>\n<p>The TweetDeck search implimentation is a killer feature.  Setup a search on keywords, and moments after it's posted, it'll appear on your desktop.  Want to know if anyone's talked about something, put in a search and you'll find out.  I've been tweeted twice this week, and I never even knew.</p>\n<p>Oh and building on the searches, it's a good way to seek out people interested in the same things as you, network, make friends, etcetera.</p>\n<h3>Follow me!</h3>\n<p>Hey, if you want to see what I tweet about, check out: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/psyked_james\">http://twitter.com/psyked_james</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"I'm on Twitter.","date":"February 05, 2009","tags":["twitter"],"url":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/fc473fda2bfca858762c20498755ba59/32ee9/twitter.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fc473fda2bfca858762c20498755ba59/10bdc/twitter.jpg 158w,\n/static/fc473fda2bfca858762c20498755ba59/f4ab0/twitter.jpg 315w,\n/static/fc473fda2bfca858762c20498755ba59/32ee9/twitter.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B2A740","darkVibrant":"#6A572C","lightVibrant":"#EEF4FC","muted":"#8C7C74","darkMuted":"#3D362F","lightMuted":"#CAC5BC"}},"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/data-binding-an-array-in-flex/","tags":["flex","array","arraycollection"],"title":"Data Binding an Array in Flex?","date":"2009-02-02T09:45:35.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/advanced-debugging-with-javascript/","tags":["javascript","debugging-tools"],"title":"Advanced Debugging with JavaScript","date":"2009-02-06T08:18:09.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
