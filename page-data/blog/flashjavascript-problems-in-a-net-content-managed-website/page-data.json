Yes, Flash does have a limited ability to set its own 'cookies' with something called <strong>LocalStorage</strong>, but there are a few advantages to actually creating 'real' cookies and working with those - not least because people understand browser cookies a little more than LocalStorage areas.</p>\n<p>The solution itself is pretty simple - you create a Javascript function to manipulate the cookie data, and then Flash uses the <strong>ExternalInteface.call</strong> function to access these javascript functions. If you want to go even more advanced, you can leverage getURL to create your Javascript functions in the first place - my favorate because it doesn’t need any external javascript.</p>\n<p>( Sometime I'll clean out the code and post an example, but for now we're going to concentrate more on the problems encountered when using this solution. )</p>\n<p>As I said, the solution is great and works in most situations however, this doesn’t work in the CMS we're using and I couldn’t figure out why. It turns that our problem was;</p>\n<h2>DOM Access</h2>\n<p>.Net pages put all the html inside a form and apparently this means that objects like embedded swfs become hidden from the Document Object Model in Internet Explorer.</p>\n<p>The solution to this is to “elevate” the object to be part of the window rather that the document. It seems that by creating a reference and using a different element in the heirarchy fixes DOM visibility issues. i.e.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>window.objectID = document.getElementById(objectID);</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A strange solution, huh?
