From this we could see that the Javascript file needed to load our page was around 300 KB in size, and uncompressed on the customer’s browser to a meaty 1.2 MB of raw code. 😱</p>\n<p>The indicative performance impact of this single file — as shown in the WebPageTest.org snapshot above — is approximately half a second. That’s half a second of the browser doing literally nothing other than downloading, parsing and executing this file, during which it displays a nothing to the user.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Generally speaking, the majority of website performance issues are Front-End problems, and not hardware or network issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/02/10/the-performance-golden-rule/\" title=\"https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/02/10/the-performance-golden-rule/\"><strong>the Performance Golden Rule</strong><br>\n_Yesterday I did a workshop at Google Ventures for some of their portfolio companies. I didn’t know how much performance…_www.stevesouders.com</a><a href=\"https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/02/10/the-performance-golden-rule/\"></a></p>\n<p>This single file is actually a React application which renders the whole page. It is render-blocking, meaning that it must be downloaded and parsed by the browser before anything on the page can display, and thus this one single file is one big problem for performance.</p>\n<h3>Page Size Matters</h3>\n<p>Everything about Page Speed and Performance is all intermingled, but Javascript file size is a good indicator of how long the file will take to download, be parsed by the browser, and then execute.</p>\n<p>There’s a certain amount of file size we can’t avoid with our Javascript. We need libraries like React for the experience we’re developing, and a shared library of components is a sensible idea, but something somewhere has gone horribly wrong if our output bundle size is so huge. — In some cases, we were seeing reports of<strong>+500Kb</strong> file size being introduced on the addition of a single button, so something wasn’t correct.</p>\n<h3>Experiment Driven Development</h3>\n<p>To take a closer look at what’s going on, we created a simple React application, looked at the application size, added a single (styled Button) component, and looked at the application size again.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\">create-react-app</a> tool outputs some pretty decent metrics as part of its default build process, so this became our quick-and-easy, side-effect free environment for testing the impact our library has on build sizes. (There could quite conceivably be issues elsewhere in the code of those making these reports, so it’s important to have a reliable benchmark.)</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/88504fb44e65395c2b76024c8de8cb5a/d40c8/1*ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 31.95%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAIAAABM9SnKAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABCUlEQVQY01WQ3U+CYBjFX3BgF6QIjuIjawHDWKkQGOC0G7e2rgTReHn5vqjV//8HBGNT2c7db+c55zlgaMIbJx3MI/IFErMYPO6AvAOK34q10e1bMphFuBoQz199A2Gqf6KAszNpVYle+bD9Vj7/ODejLIRreyA3mHcL3skFt5hsSnn7M/n4pezkbGaXqbSpBC+/W+ecg0g97E33mBo0TPY5NxfXpbjK79+L8RL1tADXwrOZMlPBq0ZGfKUfcSVoOl/Upu2sDh8uYF8/Ys25DgW0AQU3Y8waH/A28CTZZ15jycvoRUQ+HTrftmLMepJiZCDWSq/nsBnsArNWwjt1cjy2UmIadmIV/x+liUKKvvi4OwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"1 ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw\"\n        title=\"1 ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw\"\n        src=\"/static/88504fb44e65395c2b76024c8de8cb5a/6ff5e/1*ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/88504fb44e65395c2b76024c8de8cb5a/135ae/1*ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw.png 300w,\n/static/88504fb44e65395c2b76024c8de8cb5a/34e8a/1*ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw.png 600w,\n/static/88504fb44e65395c2b76024c8de8cb5a/6ff5e/1*ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw.png 1200w,\n/static/88504fb44e65395c2b76024c8de8cb5a/79a4a/1*ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw.png 1800w,\n/static/88504fb44e65395c2b76024c8de8cb5a/d40c8/1*ClStjmpOU1aVgY8WToWyBw.png 2000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>On the left: The out-of-the-box app. On the right: With a single component added.</p>\n<p>It’s not quite +500 KB gzipped, but 75 KB is still an excessive amount of code for a single styled Button.

All of these elements combine to create library bundles which fundamentally cannot be tree-shaken by Webpack.</p>\n<p>So, how to we build a tree-shakable library bundle?</p>\n<h3>A better bundler… with rollup.js</h3>\n<p>After a lot of experimenting with different options and configurations for Webpack, we eventually realised that it was ‘the wrong tool for the job’ when it came to building our bundle of library components. As a replacement we picked <a href=\"https://rollupjs.org/guide/en\">rollup.js</a>, which amongst other perks is better at producing library bundles that supports dead code elimination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rollupjs.org/guide/en\" title=\"https://rollupjs.org/guide/en\"><strong>rollup.js</strong><br>\n_Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex…_rollupjs.org</a><a href=\"https://rollupjs.org/guide/en\"></a></p>\n<p>Our consumer applications still use Webpack to package our final React applications, but using rollup.js for our library bundles now means that when Webpack compiles its output, it’s able to tree shake our library code and eliminate the components that aren’t used.</p>\n<p>And the final results?</p>\n<p>On our example project, switching to Rollup-bundled libraries immediately saves an extra 22 KB out of 75 KB (almost 30%) with literally no changes to the example application itself.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a16ab31c997bad068084d84c3e365de7/d40c8/1*IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 32.3%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAIAAABM9SnKAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABAklEQVQY02MQMI6Sto7n0w9nVAlk0ghh0YtkVA1iUA5kUAEhUbMYCatYHv1wIJtJM4xFJwIuBUKiprHSlgni5vFS1nFyjqly7tkClvGMakEQaQmguGWChEU80AJ5pzQZ90xes1iEZhHzWFn7JGmbBHmHJBmbeC7tUGaNEJDlYGlxq3gZ20RZ20QFhyQpqzgO7RAmjWCEZh7jWAmrJAGDKG7dcGagHqUABuUAuLSAabyERQKffiSXTjiTaiCaLIOAUaSsTYKISTSHVhijKpJ/wEjYNFrWJl7IKIpdE4ssg5hprKJ9CtDnQkYxXDphKAarBEqaxynZpwgZRYuaxgEtR5MFAMsHQx758ubeAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"1 IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ\"\n        title=\"1 IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ\"\n        src=\"/static/a16ab31c997bad068084d84c3e365de7/6ff5e/1*IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a16ab31c997bad068084d84c3e365de7/135ae/1*IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ.png 300w,\n/static/a16ab31c997bad068084d84c3e365de7/34e8a/1*IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ.png 600w,\n/static/a16ab31c997bad068084d84c3e365de7/6ff5e/1*IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ.png 1200w,\n/static/a16ab31c997bad068084d84c3e365de7/79a4a/1*IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ.png 1800w,\n/static/a16ab31c997bad068084d84c3e365de7/d40c8/1*IfqILOaabFh4BSnX1HcOIQ.png 2000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>On the left: Create-react-app using our library packaged with Webpack, on the right: using the library packaged with rollup.</p>\n<p>Even more exciting is the effect when we applied this same updated library to a real-world example, which yielded optimisations closer to 60% of the total file size:</p>\n<pre><code>File sizes after gzip:  287.02 KB (-430.7 KB)  build/static/js/main.5978ff57.js\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>430.7 KB</strong> saved from our output bundle, thanks to using a tree-shakable React Component library, bundled with properly-configured Rollup instead of our out-of-the-box Webpack configuration.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Our React Component library was part of a natural evolution from several projects, but we took our eye off the performance impact of the code that we were building and it quickly snowballed into something that had detrimental effect on the projects that included it.</p>\n<p>The root cause of this problem was our bundling strategy, and the fact that it couldn’t determine which code was necessary to render the components, so it always included everything.</p>\n<p>The solution was to shift our bundling strategy into Rollup and also to change our Babel configuration to one that better supported dead-code elimination.</p>\n<p>Webpack isn’t a bad tool, but it has to be configured properly and used for the correct tasks, and because of the gradual nature of our project evolution, our setup wasn’t suitable. Pausing, evaluating, and spending some time focussing on our build processes has allowed us to make these gains.</p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Javascript syntax patterns, such as CommonJS, have different side effects when it comes to dead-code elimination in your code bundler.</li>\n<li>Webpack is good for bundling projects, but Rollup is better for libraries.</li>\n<li>You’re still going to need Babel, regardless of whether you’re working with Webpack or Rollup. It’s the Babel configuration which has the biggest effect on the outcome.</li>\n<li>Test, test and test again, and do it in an environment that is representative of your anticipated customers’ workspace.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Bonus: Create-React-App 2 &#x26; Webpack 4</h3>\n<p>Since originally penning this article, we’ve had clients update to using <a
