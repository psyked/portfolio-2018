That is after all, what I have this site for. In his post, Ryan is sharing his thoughts on the approach to tagging on <a href=\"http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00029Y\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">Ask E.

Of course, if you're going to have related posts, it makes sense to draw them from the tagging system.</p>\n<p>I'm currently using the <a href=\"http://www.w-a-s-a-b-i.com/archives/2006/02/02/wordpress-related-entries-20/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">related posts plugin for wordpress</a> - I don't know how it works, but it does - and I don't have an issue with it, but I wonder what it would be like to do something similar to Edward Tuftes'. In theory, you'd just be adding a listing of all posts within a category, for each tag. It's certainly not a bad idea - if implimented correctly - so does that mean it is, in fact, a good idea? If we could get the listings into a condensed AJAX-ish dropdown, similar to the behaviour of the 'Share this' plugin, we might even be on to a winner...</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"A different approach to tagging?","date":"February 03, 2008","tags":["external-links","tagging","wordpress-plugins"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/xslt-and-rss-feeds/","tags":["html","rss-tag","xsl","xslt"],"title":"XSLT and RSS feeds.","date":"2008-01-30T23:09:58.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/i-found-one-of-my-old-uni-projects/","tags":["actionscript","flash","university-projects"],"title":"I found one of my old uni projects...","date":"2008-02-04T23:01:04.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.0454545454545454,"src":"/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/32fd5/uniproject.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/426bb/uniproject.jpg 158w,\n/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/6544a/uniproject.jpg 315w,\n/static/e90b8d69f695b9a47217f7e24971d3ff/32fd5/uniproject.jpg 450w","sizes":"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"}}}}}}}}
