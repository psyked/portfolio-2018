The REST webservice I'm using requires raw XML data, but the HTTPService class doesn't do that.</p>\n<p>The solution?  Well, there's only one - don't use the HTTPService class, and code everything yourself.  Thankfully, this link I found tells you exactly how to do that, along with examples.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tacfug.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/26/Flex--Posting-XML-without-using-mxhttpservice-\">http://tacfug.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/26/Flex--Posting-XML-without-using-mxhttpservice-</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Link: POSTing XML data, without using HTTPService","date":"June 21, 2009","tags":["external-links","flex","httpservice","post-tag","rest"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/what-are-you-looking-at-introducing-screentweetr/","tags":["screentweetr","twitter","air","tweetphoto","twitpic"],"title":"What are you looking at?
