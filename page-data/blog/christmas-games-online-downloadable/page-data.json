Last year we canibalized an old promotional game - spruced it up with some snazzy graphics - and unleashed it upon the world. <a href=\"http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/Christmas/game/main.html\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">[See the 2006 Game]</a> This year (2007) MMT Digital is continuing - and improving upon - that fine tradition, bringing you a <a href=\"http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/downloads\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">trio of festive games</a>, available online or via download.</p>\n<h3>//end marketing-speak;</h3>\n<p>Seriously though, this years' games are pretty good. The activities themselves are pretty simple concepts, along the lines of memory / watching games, point &#x26; click and speed-counting. No frustrating learning curves etc etc. The most exciting part of it all, from the programmers' point of view, is the delivery method. We're starting to move away from <em>Adobe / Macromedia Director</em> as a delivery method for our flash content, and into new realms - ones which allow snazzy shaped windows and faster build times.</p>\n<p>However, internal projects always get a rough ride - being testbeds for new technologies - and this is no exception.</p>\n<h3>The plan?</h3>\n<p>The inital aim was to really break the mold. Instead of last years' online game, we'd have an <em>application</em>, with a multitude of games. Furthermore, we could use new technologies to create a transparent-desktop application, to really 'wow' people. Mark had created an awesome carousel in flash, and previously written some nice, technically-clever games for various clients. Everything sorta... clicked together. Brilliant when that happens.</p>\n<h3>The problems?</h3>\n<p>As it turned out, we couldn't get transparency compatible with Macs and the transparent desktop applications suffered a heavy loss in framerate on the PC. While that's ok for simple applications, fast-paced animations (such as custom cursors) were rendered pretty useless. End-clients are rarely forgiving if your products aren't perfect, so the transparency got canned. Luckily, we had a few die-hard programmers (myself included) who campaigned for the inclusion of a transparent version - if only to prove it could be done - and we got our way.</p>\n<h3>Go get it!</h3>\n<p>The 'Gold version', the recommended application that we unveiled to our E-Newsletter subscribers, is a 4Mb application with both PC and Mac versions. Recommended / required screen resolution is 1024x768, and it runs in fullscreen mode. Undoubtably the best version for playing the games, but nothing we couldn't've produced in Director.</p>\n<p>You can download the transparent-desktop version from the 'Under development' section of the downloads page. Obviously the transparency is the reason for downloading this, because it's just much more awesome to look at.</p>\n<p>With codename 'Pandora' being due for release in January 2008, we hope to have a much more efficient, transparent-desktop version of the festive games available in early 2008.</p>\n<p>As usual, if you'd like to join MMT Digitals' mailing list, send an appropriate email to enquiries[at]mmtdigital.co.uk.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Christmas Games â€“ Online & Downloadable","date":"December 17, 2007","tags":["external-links","flash","christmas-games","mdm-zinc"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/identifying-link-targets-with-css/","tags":["css","icons"],"title":"Identifying link targets with CSS","date":"2007-12-05T08:06:19.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/automatic-link-icons-v20/","tags":["css","external-links","javascript","icons"],"title":"Automatic Link Icons v2.0","date":"2008-01-08T20:20:05.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
