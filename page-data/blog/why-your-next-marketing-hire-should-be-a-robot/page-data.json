One proven way to achieve a positive experience is for them to have a personalised experience, and a personalised experience can come from tailored communications and data-led interventions.</p>\n<h3>Hire a Robot?</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately for your business, a truly personalised experience is a labour-intensive thing to construct and  maintain manually. You <em>could</em> send regular messages to individuals asking for feedback, you could offer them discounts, you could look at their shopping habits and try to capitalise on them, but you'll quickly hit a point where such activities stop being scalable without hiring more humans.</p>\n<p>At that point, hire a Robot instead. Or at least, invest some time and/or money wisely and build yourself some tools to achieve marketing automation.</p>\n<h3>[What is] Marketing Automation?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-automation-information\">Marketing Automation</a> is a bit of a catch-all term, but essentially it involves breaking down business-to-customer communications into identifiable chunks and finding ways to replace a manual human process into a completely automated one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you've ever got a (perhaps slightly impersonal) email from a company exactly 30 days after purchasing something, that's probably marketing automation at work. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you get a chat window pop-up midway shortly after returning to a website shopping basket you'd almost abandoned, that's also probably marketing automation at work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Put shortly, <strong>everyone else is already doing it.</strong> If you've not got automatons grooming your customers and making them feel special, <strong>it's about time you looked at doing it as well.</strong></p>\n<p>Header image courtesy of: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/74471232@N00/4530183325/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/74471232@N00/4530183325/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why your Next Marketing Hire should be a Robot.","date":"January 03, 2017","tags":["automating","seo","marketing"],"url":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAMABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQADBP/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAHBgLqNUjYr/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAEgMRISL/2gAIAQEAAQUCQC6apMZ9E9uwn//EABcRAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhH/2gAIAQMBAT8BrLX/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARL/2gAIAQIBAT8BsZf/xAAaEAACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARESIDFB/9oACAEBAAY/AoZXqw2f/8QAGhABAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIVExcf/aAAgBAQABPyFxHKyuygJ28hl/Y1G97FRfJ5hz/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCwH//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQf/aAAgBAwEBPxDRL//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARIf/aAAgBAgEBPxC2Kf/EABsQAQADAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExUWGh/9oACAEBAAE/EH8LSFV+EQsOq7V58gEETXSBMhNUdjarUTkMPc//2Q==","aspectRatio":1.6675381263616558,"src":"/static/4d5f86c39706b2efb707210569a56d6a/30037/4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4d5f86c39706b2efb707210569a56d6a/10bdc/4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg 158w,\n/static/4d5f86c39706b2efb707210569a56d6a/f4ab0/4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg 315w,\n/static/4d5f86c39706b2efb707210569a56d6a/30037/4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg 630w,\n/static/4d5f86c39706b2efb707210569a56d6a/9810d/4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg 945w,\n/static/4d5f86c39706b2efb707210569a56d6a/ff2e4/4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg 1260w,\n/static/4d5f86c39706b2efb707210569a56d6a/925ea/4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg 3827w","sizes":"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#E2B380","darkVibrant":"#1B323B","lightVibrant":"#FAEDB9","muted":"#AB7863","darkMuted":"#3B4546","lightMuted":"#C8B496"}},"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/is-it-time-to-use-visual-studio-code-as-your-ide/","tags":["microsoft","tools"],"title":"Is it time to use Visual Studio Code as your IDE?","date":"2016-12-28T19:45:00.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/rituals-dogma-and-the-agile-manifesto/","tags":null,"title":"Rituals, dogma and the Agile Manifesto.","date":"2017-01-04T13:17:00.753Z","description":"I can’t quite work out if Agile is a buzzword, a cult or some larger form of organised religion.
