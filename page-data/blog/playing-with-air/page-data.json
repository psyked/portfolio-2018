Well ok, it sounds boring, but it's a starting point. I'm not finished yet, but my deadline is pretty harsh (Wednesday, in fact!) so I'm hoping to have another update tomorrow, once I've ironed out a few remaining bugs (and removed the chance that the application will corrupt your files!)</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/24ba54c3cdc379f38b010014d7676185/48a11/adobeairpost.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"adobeairpost.jpg\"\n        title=\"adobeairpost.jpg\"\n        src=\"/static/24ba54c3cdc379f38b010014d7676185/48a11/adobeairpost.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/24ba54c3cdc379f38b010014d7676185/afcd2/adobeairpost.jpg 300w,\n/static/24ba54c3cdc379f38b010014d7676185/48a11/adobeairpost.jpg 500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>This Air app. should take an ANSI or other unusually formatted text file, and save it out as UTF-8.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>The need for this app. is pretty simple, really. If you make a Macro - don't shudder - to export MS Office content to text files (like, xml files) you can't specify the encoding of the outputted files. Although the content makes it out, it's encoded in (usually) Windows-1252 format (aka ANSI). When Flash - or many other XML-reading products, like Internet Explorer or Firefox - import the XML file, and come across incorrectly encoded characters, they tend to crash and burn. If the file is properly saved as UTF-8 however, everyone plays nicely. Now this can be done by opening the file in notepad and changing the encoding type, but that wouldn't be so fun, would it?</p>\n<h2>When can I try it?</h2>\n<p>A safe, stable version should be available aroundabout the 9th April.
