It's formatted recipe style, with a motley collection of self-contained recipes that demonstrate some of what you can do with Flash and Facebook combined.</p>\n<p><strong>Who is it for?</strong> Well, it's written with the assumption that you're at least a <em>little</em> familiar with Flash Builder and the Flex framework - that way, we don't have to waste too much on building user interfaces. If you're more used to using other IDE's like FDT, Intellij or FlashDevelop that's not a problem, we just tend to throw an interface together with MXML and wire it up with ActionScript. You could even work with Flash Professional if you like - the important stuff is all in the ActionScript, after all.</p>\n<p>As for the writing itself, it's much more than just a set of recipes - or so I hope - as I've tried to include more than just the solution, but also the reasons and the theory behind the different facets of working with Facebook. It might be a long read, cover-to-cover, but the idea is that when you've done so you'll know Facebook just as well as you would if you'd had to figure it all out for yourself, from scratch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/flash-facebook-cookbook-for-graph-api-applications/book\"><img src=\"/content/images/2011/09/packt-website-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Packt website screenshot\"></a></p>\n<p>You can either buy the printed version of the Cookbook or the download the eBook version, <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/flash-facebook-cookbook-for-graph-api-applications/book\" title=\"Open the Packt Publishing website in a new window/tab.\">direct from Packt Publishing website</a> or from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Facebook-Cookbook-James-Ford/dp/1849690723\" title=\"Open the Flash Facebook Cookbook on Amazon.com, in a new window/tab.\">Amazon.com</a>/<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flash-Facebook-Cookbook-James-Ford/dp/1849690723\" title=\"Open the Flash Facebook Cookbook on Amazon.co.uk, in a new window/tab.\">.co.uk</a>.
