Lee Brimelows 'Platform Jiu-Jitsu' was fun - a combined introduction to UFC and Flash CS4. The final inspire session in the evening was, well, inspiring - with Robert Hodgin's 'The Best 8 to 12 Hours of my Life.' in which he talks about drugs having a lot to do with his inspiration. Which seemed to be a common theme amongst the arty types.</p>\n<p>Here's a couple of resources I've found from that day...</p>\n<h3>Things every Flash developer should know</h3>\n<p>[<img src=\"/adf026731cc2d03babe8fa77b0971715/gskinner.gif\"></p>\n<h3>The Best 8 to 12 Hours of my Life.</h3>\n<p> <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/1882582?pg=embed&#x26;sec=1882582\">FOTB 2008 - Brighton - Robert Hodgin - 01</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/jonmacdonald?pg=embed&#x26;sec=1882582\">Jon MacDonald</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&#x26;sec=1882582\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>I didn't get to the party on Monday night thanks to having to work - but I got there on Tuesday night. A nightclub with over 1000 flash developers in - certainly not the nightclub experience I remember from University!</p>\n<p>Following that on Wednesday we had another couple of great sessions - 'Advanced Flexing for Flash Developers' delivered by what I assume was a hungover Ben Stucki, and the massively popular 'Papervision3D Simplified' by Seb Lee-Delisle. Those were rounded off in the afternoon with 'The Ying and Yang of Flash' - a look at the behind-the-scenes development of the Flash player by Paul Betlem, before Jonathan Harris went and finished the whole thing up with his 'Beyond Flash' talk - which was kinda depressing.
