I'd love to know...</p>\n<h3>Source files:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/11/splash-screen-demo.zip\">Click here to download the Flex Project Archive.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Future Development...</h3>\n<p>Given a little more time, you could incorporate more things, like status messages and event handlers, to update the splash screen as the application loads - kinda like Photoshop - or you could (should?) extend parts of the display - like the version number - to read in variables dynamically from the application settings file.  All things for a followup tutorial, methinks.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"10 minute Flex / AIR tutorial -
