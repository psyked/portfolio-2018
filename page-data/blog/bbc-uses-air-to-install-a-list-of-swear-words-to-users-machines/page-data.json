Once it's installed, go to your application directory (Program Files) and <strong>BBC Olympics</strong> > <strong>assets</strong> > <strong>data</strong> > <a href=\"http://www.psyked.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/bbc-swear.txt\"><strong>bbc-swear.txt</strong></a> and you'll be privvy to a 15kb, 1399 lines long list of bad words.</p>\n<p>This is such an ridiculous error that I’m practically lost for words. For an audience as big as the BBC’s you think they’d be mindful about offending people – every other part of the development must have undergone a review process – but bundling a highly offensive text file with your application?</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Perhaps there’s a reason for the BBC’s Olympics Application to contain a list of restricted words, but for the love of god, don’t store them in an unencrypted text file that’s written to the user’s hard drive - store it in a database format, a non .txt extension, encrypted storage, or even on a remote server – but <strong>do not store it as a text file!</strong></p>\n<h2>On the funny side...</h2>\n<p>Most of these words I haven’t heard since school, and many of them I’ve never heard of.  Although, beyond childish giggles, this isn't really funny - I don't think its nessessary, and looking at the contents, I have doubts about how useful it really is...</p>\n<h2>No really, why?</h2>\n<p>From an efficiency (programatic) point of view, the text file has some truly odd contents...</p>\n<p>If you’re going to search for the word ‘tosser’ then do a <strong>regular expression</strong> for the word ‘tosser’ – and perhaps a regular expression for the l33t-speak variant – don’t just search for these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“to$$ers, to**er, to55er, to55ers, tosser, tosser, tossers, tossurs”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because a slight misspelling is going to get past, is it not?</p>\n<p>Anyway, there’s much that can be said about it - and I'm sure much will be said about it.  <a href=\"http://www.ashorten.com/2008/07/17/bbc-olympics-coverage-on-your-desktop-with-air-and-on-the-web-with-flash-player/\">Andrew Shorten</a> has been promoting it, I wonder what he has to say?</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"BBC uses Adobe AIR to install a list of swear words to users machines.","date":"August 05, 2008","tags":["bbc","olypmics","swearing"],"url":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/e9e611abe55649998a5d68184c61fa63/32ee9/bbc-swear.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e9e611abe55649998a5d68184c61fa63/10bdc/bbc-swear.jpg 158w,\n/static/e9e611abe55649998a5d68184c61fa63/f4ab0/bbc-swear.jpg 315w,\n/static/e9e611abe55649998a5d68184c61fa63/32ee9/bbc-swear.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}},"colors":{"vibrant":"#B6853F","darkVibrant":"#743A26","lightVibrant":"#E4B49D","muted":"#907D71","darkMuted":"#57493B","lightMuted":"#D1C7B6"}},"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/exempli-gratia-using-tweener/","tags":["flash","actionscript","animation","google-code","open-source"],"title":"Exempli Gratia : Using Tweener","date":"2008-07-18T18:53:31.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/e8ef61c10c7f6dff6d069f53cea208ed/32ee9/googelcode.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e8ef61c10c7f6dff6d069f53cea208ed/10bdc/googelcode.jpg 158w,\n/static/e8ef61c10c7f6dff6d069f53cea208ed/f4ab0/googelcode.jpg 315w,\n/static/e8ef61c10c7f6dff6d069f53cea208ed/32ee9/googelcode.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/bbc-sports-air-application-removes-its-offensive-language/","tags":["air","auto-updating","bbc","olympics","swearing"],"title":"BBC Sports' AIR Application removes its offensive language","date":"2008-08-05T15:39:07.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/adb351016b45ac91d45a568b990934a7/32ee9/bbc-fixed.jpg","srcSet":"/static/adb351016b45ac91d45a568b990934a7/10bdc/bbc-fixed.jpg 158w,\n/static/adb351016b45ac91d45a568b990934a7/f4ab0/bbc-fixed.jpg 315w,\n/static/adb351016b45ac91d45a568b990934a7/32ee9/bbc-fixed.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}}}}
