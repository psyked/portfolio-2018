Nope, me neither - but it turned out to be the function I was looking for yesterday.</p>\n<p>Anyway, by far the best introduction to ActionScript 3 (not just the function name changes) is one I found from <strong>Senocular</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.senocular.com/flash/tutorials/as3withflashcs3/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">Getting Started with ActionScript 3 (for Flash).</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Trouble migrating to Actionscript 3?","date":"February 27, 2008","tags":["actionscript"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/css-selection-styles/","tags":["css"],"title":"CSS Selection Styles?","date":"2008-02-24T12:00:40.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/sifr-links-not-working/","tags":["flash"],"title":"sIFR links not working?","date":"2008-03-07T21:30:24.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
