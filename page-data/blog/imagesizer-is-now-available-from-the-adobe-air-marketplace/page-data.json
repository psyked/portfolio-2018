 Updates you say?</h3>\n<p>Well first off, apologies to anyone who was using ImageSizer regularily - a couple of automatic updates went out recently, and both of them had a few bugs in them.  One made the application fail totally on Multiscreen setups - and the other well, wasn't so critical.</p>\n<p>Anyway, those are fixed now!</p>\n<p>ImageSizer is now at version 0.4.4.7 - in honour of it's release on the AIR Marketplace we've introduced a few more tweaks to the application settings, removed the somewhat annoying alerts at the start, and attempted to make the interface a bit more intuative.  Why don't you download it and try it out now!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/735f7489d1596f706048ea605a41acf8/48a11/imagesizer2.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"ImageSizer on AIR Marketplace\"\n        title=\"ImageSizer on AIR Marketplace\"\n        src=\"/static/735f7489d1596f706048ea605a41acf8/48a11/imagesizer2.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/735f7489d1596f706048ea605a41acf8/afcd2/imagesizer2.jpg 300w,\n/static/735f7489d1596f706048ea605a41acf8/48a11/imagesizer2.jpg 500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ImageSizer is now available from the Adobe AIR Marketplace!","date":"February 13, 2009","tags":["imagesizer","air","air-marketplace"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/how-to-poach-pixel-bender-filters/","tags":["pixel-bender"],"title":"How to: poach Pixel Bender filters.","date":"2009-02-12T08:28:04.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/best-practice-for-air-applications-1-of-7/","tags":["air","best-practice"],"title":"Best Practice for AIR applications (1 of 7)","date":"2009-02-15T23:53:08.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
