You can then watch the video for up to 30 days after you've downloaded it online or offline. They've used a Flash Media Rights Management Server to DRM-Protect content so you shouldn't be able to get to the video file. Pretty cool stuff.</p>\n<p>You can find more info here: <a href=\"http://www.ashorten.com/2008/12/19/bbc-launches-iplayer-desktop-on-adobe-air/\">http://www.ashorten.com/2008/12/19/bbc-launches-iplayer-desktop-on-adobe-air/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"BBC Releases an AIR version of the iPlayer","date":"December 22, 2008","tags":["air-applications","bbc"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/e-newsletter-the-benefits-of-using-adobe-air/","tags":["air","e-newsletter"],"title":"E-Newsletter / The benefits of using Adobe AIR.","date":"2008-12-19T21:34:22.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/imagesizer-updated-to-version-0310/","tags":["imagesizer"],"title":"ImageSizer - updated to version 0.3.10!","date":"2008-12-22T14:11:45.000Z","description":null,"image":null}}}}}
