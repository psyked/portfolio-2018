I am of course, referrring to the <a href=\"http://www.psyked.co.uk/adobe/flash/sifr-links-not-working.htm\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">issues that were encountered with sIFR Flash links</a>, caused by the Flash Player version 9.0.115 (kudos to <a href=\"http://novemberborn.net/\">Mark Wubben</a> for explaining this to me) and also in more general terms to the introduction of a rigid security model with Flash Player 8.</p>\n<p>While we're always doing our best to code in the most secure, efficent ways - like for example, using the <strong>ExternalInterface</strong> class as opposed to communicating with javascript via <strong>getURL(javascript:)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.psyked.co.uk/actionscript/actionscript-geturl-vs-externalinterface-when-why.htm\">[1]</a> - there's situations where these techniques weren't available at the time they were written, and these are going to be broken by the update.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/flash_player9_security_update.html#javascript\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">Adobe's solution?</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your content is using \"javascript:\" within the prohibited networking APIs, you will need to rewrite your content. Developers are encouraged to use the ExternalInterface class for JavaScript-to-ActionScript communication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rewrite your code?! That like, must be breaking some unwritten rule of versioning, surely? Files published under a different version shouldn't be mercy to the whims of newer players - otherwise, what's the point?</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.unitzeroone.com/blog/2008/03/11/developers-beware-upcoming-flash-security-update-april-2008/\" title=\"Open link in a new window\">UnitZeroOne</a> for their article which tipped me off.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"09/04/08 Flash Player security update","date":"March 16, 2008","tags":["flash","javascript","externalinterface","geturl"],"url":null,"image":null,"description":null,"image_credit":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"prev":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/sifr-links-not-working/","tags":["flash"],"title":"sIFR links not working?","date":"2008-03-07T21:30:24.000Z","description":null,"image":null}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"path":"/blog/custom-character-set-embedding-in-flash/","tags":["flash","fonts"],"title":"Custom character-set embedding in Flash","date":"2008-03-25T22:13:11.000Z","description":null,"image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7857142857142858,"src":"/static/9b5b3fecfed1154b658bd6810115e90d/32ee9/customfontembedding.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9b5b3fecfed1154b658bd6810115e90d/10bdc/customfontembedding.jpg 158w,\n/static/9b5b3fecfed1154b658bd6810115e90d/f4ab0/customfontembedding.jpg 315w,\n/static/9b5b3fecfed1154b658bd6810115e90d/32ee9/customfontembedding.jpg 500w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}}}}}}
