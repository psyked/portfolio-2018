That's because they make use of XHTML and namespaces. Sure, mixing XHTML and HTML5 together on a single page works just fine for the end-user, but when it comes to validating your pages on the W3C, it just won't work.</p>\n<p>What's the 'solution'? Why, hacking it, of course. Take the code for those elements out of the source, and embed it with JavaScript instead. Â And it doesn't have to be complex either - you can use inline JavaScript code.</p>\n<p>Wrap your button embed HTML in a <script> tag, add a CDATA block, and encompass it in a <code>document.write()</code> function, and you're done.</p>\n<p>So this code:</p>\n<p>Becomes this code:</p>\n<p>Of course, this being a hack, I can't really speak for this being good practice, but it works.
