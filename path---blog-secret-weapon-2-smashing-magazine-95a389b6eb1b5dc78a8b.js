Well, at least that\'s what I assume.  Behind the ads* there\'s a wealth of decent resources, and it\'s updated at a furious rate.  For example, there seems to be 100 links+ in each of their \'<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/digest/" title="Open Smashing Magazine\'s Best of Month Articles in a new window" target="_blank">Best of Month</a>\' articles.
