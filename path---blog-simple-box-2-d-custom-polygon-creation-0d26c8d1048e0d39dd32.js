So we now have an easy way to add mouse joints to move things about.  In the next version it\'s my plan to add a method for filtering out objects, presumably based on each bodies userData.</p>\n<p>world.mouseInteraction = true;</p>\n<h3>Minor thing #2: Framerate-independent animation.</h3>\n<p>I stole this idea wholeheartedly from <a href="http://actionsnippet.com/?p=1471">QuickBox2D</a>.  Too good an idea to pass up I\'m afraid, this just means that the simulation of the Box2D world is based on a timer, not a framerate.  In theory then, the simulation doesn\'t slow down or speed up depending on the framerate - which is useful for many things, like graphic-intensive applications and/or memory optimisation.</p>\n<p>world.framerateIndependantAnimation = true;</p>\n<p>And here\'s some code for a quick example with framerate independent animation and mouse interaction enabled;</p>\n<pre><code>var options:Box2DWorldOptions = new Box2DWorldOptions( 500, 280, 30, 9.8 );\noptions.setWorldEdges( true, true, true, true );\nvar world:Box2DWorld = Box2DUtils.createBoxedWorld( options );\nworld.debugDraw = true;\nworld.mouseInteractExclusions = new Array();\nworld.mouseInteraction = true;\nworld.framerateIndependantAnimation = true;\naddChild( world );\n</code></pre>\n<p>I\'ve compiled all of my source files into a handy project file if you want to take a look.  Documentation and comments are a bit sparse, but hopefully it\'ll prove useful!</p>\n<h2><a href="/portfolio-2018/content/images/2010/01/box2dutils.zip">Download the project files [Zip, 48kb]</a></h2>\n<p><a href="/portfolio-2018/content/images/2010/01/simples.jpg"><img src="/content/images/2010/01/simples.jpg" title="simples"></a></p>\n<p>Simples!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Simple Box2D - Custom Polygon creation.",date:"January 11, 2010",tags:["actionscript","box2d"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
