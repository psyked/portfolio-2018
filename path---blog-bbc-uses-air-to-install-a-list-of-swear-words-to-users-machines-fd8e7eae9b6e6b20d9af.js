Once it\'s installed, go to your application directory (Program Files) and <strong>BBC Olympics</strong> > <strong>assets </strong>> <strong>data </strong>> <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/bbc-swear.txt" target="_blank"><strong>bbc-swear.txt\n</strong></a> and you\'ll be privvy to a 15kb, 1399 lines long list of bad words.</p>\n<p>This is such an ridiculous error that I’m practically lost for words.  For an audience as big as the BBC’s you think they’d be mindful about offending people – every other part of the development must have undergone a review process – but bundling a highly offensive text file with your application?</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\nPerhaps there’s a reason for the BBC’s Olympics Application to contain a list of restricted words, but for the love of god, don’t store them in an unencrypted text file that’s written to the user’s hard drive - store it in a database format, a non .txt extension, encrypted storage, or even on a remote server – but <strong>do not store it as a text file!</strong>\n<h2>On the funny side...</h2>\nMost of these words I haven’t heard since school, and many of them I’ve never heard of.  Although, beyond childish giggles, this isn\'t really funny - I don\'t think its nessessary, and looking at the contents, I have doubts about how useful it really is...\n<h2>No really, why?</h2>\nFrom an efficiency (programatic) point of view, the text file has some truly odd contents...\n<p>If you’re going to search for the word ‘tosser’ then do a <strong>regular expression</strong> for the word ‘tosser’ – and perhaps a regular expression for the l33t-speak variant – don’t just search for these words:</p>\n<blockquote>“to$$ers, to**er, to55er, to55ers, tosser, tosser, tossers, tossurs”</blockquote>\nBecause a slight misspelling is going to get past, is it not?\n<p>Anyway, there’s much that can be said about it - and I\'m sure much will be said about it.  <a href="http://www.ashorten.com/2008/07/17/bbc-olympics-coverage-on-your-desktop-with-air-and-on-the-web-with-flash-player/" target="_blank">Andrew Shorten</a> has been promoting it, I wonder what he has to say?</p>',frontmatter:{title:"BBC uses Adobe AIR to install a list of swear words to users machines.",date:"August 05, 2008",tags:["bbc","olypmics","swearing"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
