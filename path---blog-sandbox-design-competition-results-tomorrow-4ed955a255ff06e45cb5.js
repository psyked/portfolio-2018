Hands-down, Sandpress has the professional polish that makes all other entries pale in comparision. Shades is nice overall, with good structure, but lacks oopfh. MIX has a nice structure, but some nasty colours and graphics. Blackbox is a bit rough, but I like how different and bold the design is - but as for being adopted as a mainstream, bundled theme (which is what the competition is about), I don\'t think there\'s a chance.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Sandbox Design competition (results tomorrow)",date:"August 05, 2007",tags:["competitions","sandbox","wordpress-themes"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
