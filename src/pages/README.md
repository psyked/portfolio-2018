## Introductions

> _Hi, I'm James._

I prefer James when face-to-face. My online handle / username is predominantly **@psyked.**

### Why this website/document exists

Writing a self-README feels like a good way to share my own thoughts about working with myself, in a format that's curated by me and always available - unlike an email, Slack message or passing conversations which could get lost or misrepresented over time. [Plus, all of the cool kids are doing it.](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe)

## About Me

### Personality

By some definitions I'm an Introvert, and by others an Extrovert. If you're interested, I come out as an ["Architect" (INTJ)](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) or a ["Mediator" (INFP)](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality) in Myers-Briggs tests, according to how I'm feeling. In practice that generally means that in chaotic or social environments I tend towards being more quiet and reserved, but I'm motivated by the feedback of other people rather than myself.

### Social Media & other websites

I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/psyked) and [Instagram,](https://www.instagram.com/psyked/) if you're interested.

I'm also on [GitHub,](https://github.com/psyked/) [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/psyked1) and [StackOverflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/users/377961/james-ford) I publish articles as often as I can on [Medium,](https://medium.com/@psyked) and mirror them on [GitHub Pages.](https://psyked.github.io/blog/)

### Hobbies & Interests

I read for pleasure and I enjoy writing. I prefer Science Fiction or Fantasy Novels and the occasional Thriller. I appreciate good, engaging writing.
