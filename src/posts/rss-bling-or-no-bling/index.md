Times move fast on the web.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">RSS</a> has been mainstream for quite a while.  So long, in fact, that RSS readers are now built into the two major windows browsers, Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2.  It's been inbuilt for longer on the Mac, I hear.
So, in our busy little 'Web 2.0' designs, why does the staple ingredient of Blogs and Community websites need to be emblazoned in the design?  I mean, what's the point?

Ok, let's backtrack my thoughts a bit.  I was perusing <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/09/twenty-usability-tips-for-your-blog-%e2%80%94-condensed-from-dozens-of-bloggers-experiences/" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">this article</a>, which does a roundup of 'Usability Tips' for your Blog.  I consider myself a bit of a usability, uh.. well, a bit knowledgable on the subject.  <strong>Point #3 is 'Make it easy to subscribe'</strong> talking about RSS and Podcast subscribing;
<blockquote>Make it easy to subscribe to your feed by placing an orange RSS button in a highly visible location. Route your feed through Feedburner so you can keep track of your subscribers. You can also offer an e-mail subscription using FeedBurner.</blockquote>
I disagree with this, however.  If you've got properly set-up links and metadata in your pages, your browser should be able to detect it, like this;
<p align="center"> <img src="/content/images/2007/05/firefoxrss.gif" alt="Firefox RSS Detection" /> <img src="/content/images/2007/05/ie7rss.gif" alt="IE7 RSS detection" /></p>
So there's no real need for a big button, right?  I suppose it's down to old understated / overstated design issue.  If you want to look bright and shiny and 'Web 2.0' you stick a big RSS button on.  That way no-one will miss the opportunity to subscribe.  Frankly though, I always read the content before deciding if I might want to subscribe to the RSS.  If I do, i'll look for the RSS detection in my browser, which has to handle the process anyway.

Usability is all about clarity and optimizing the click-process.  So don't go overloading your pages with shiny buttons that aren't nessessary, and don't blithely add them because everyone else does.  You'll thank me when the backlash arrives.
