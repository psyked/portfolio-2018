Wow.  That's another day gone - its funny really, you feel like you've been here for ages based on what you've seen, but then you step back and realise it's only Monday.

John Davis' Keynote was a good introduction - teasing us with the features of Flash Player 10 - and setting us up for Wednesdays' session on "The Ying and Yang of Flash".  I missed the mornings session on [“Mash-up widgets with Adobe AIR”](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2194), but caught Brendan Halls' [“Brilliant Ideas that I’ve blatantly stolen”](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2112) \- which had some really interesting ideas - and saw Thermo in all its prerelease glory at Mark Anders' ["A Preview of Flex 4 and 'Thermo'"](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2174)

Really interesting however was the session by Erik Natzke on ["Beyond the Knowledge: The Art of Play"](http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2101) where he showed how he's developed Flash into and art tool, and uses it to create works of art like the one above and those on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/natzke/) and [his blog](http://jot.eriknatzke.com/).  Inspiring stuff.

As for the social side of things, Mark met '[the guy who wrote Tweener](http://natejc.com/blog/)' although I missed him.

Beer and sessions are another inspired idea for networking, and we also met Tim and Kyle from [Team Cooper Ltd.](http://www.teamcooper.co.uk/).

On Tueday we've got sessions by Lee Brimelow and Grant Skinner so no doubt they'll be awesome.
