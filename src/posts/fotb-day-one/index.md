Wow.  That's another day gone - its funny really, you feel like you've been here for ages based on what you've seen, but then you step back and realise it's only Monday.

John Davis' Keynote was a good introduction - teasing us with the features of Flash Player 10 - and setting us up for Wednesdays' session on "The Ying and Yang of Flash".  I missed the mornings session on <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.flashonthebeach.com');" href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2194" target="_blank">“Mash-up widgets with Adobe AIR”</a>, but caught Brendan Halls' <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview ('/outbound/www.flashonthebeach.com');" href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2112" target="_blank">“Brilliant Ideas that I’ve blatantly stolen”</a> - which had some really interesting ideas - and saw Thermo in all its prerelease glory at Mark Anders' <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2174">"A Preview of Flex 4 and 'Thermo'"</a>

Really interesting however was the session by Erik Natzke on <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2101">"Beyond the Knowledge: The Art of Play"</a> where he showed how he's developed Flash into and art tool, and uses it to create works of art like the one above and those on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natzke/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/" target="_blank">his blog</a>.  Inspiring stuff.

As for the social side of things, Mark met '<a href="http://natejc.com/blog/" target="_blank">the guy who wrote Tweener</a>' although I missed him.

Beer and sessions are another inspired idea for networking, and we also met Tim and Kyle from <a href="http://www.teamcooper.co.uk/" target="_blank">Team Cooper Ltd.</a>.

On Tueday we've got sessions by Lee Brimelow and Grant Skinner so no doubt they'll be awesome.
