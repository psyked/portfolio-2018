From côdeazur:
<blockquote><strong>FZip</strong>

FZip is an Actionscript 3 class library to load standard
ZIP archives and extract/decompress contained files.

FZip parses ZIP archives progressively, allowing access
to contained files while the archive is loading.</blockquote>

The potential for this is impressive, and they've already implimented it in ways I wouldn't've thought possible - an automatic .air file update checker.  I'm not even sure there is a file format left that the ActionScript 3 trio can't manipulate...
