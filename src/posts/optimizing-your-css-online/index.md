Another useful link, this time for Optimizing &amp; Formatting CSS files.

The <a href="http://www.cdburnerxp.se/cssparse/css_optimiser.php" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">CSS Formatter / Optimizer</a> is an online form, that can format your CSS in a variety of ways.  Just copy &amp; paste, select your options, and the form will chuck your formatted CSS back at you.  Why use it?  Well, I'm still using Dreamweaver 8, and although it's very competent at things like XML and HTML formatting, it's no good at doing CSS.  I like to use this website towards the end of my projects, and it makes your stuff so much neater (and more efficent, if need be)<!--more-->

Doesn't look like much, as I'm sure you'll agree, but these techie things don't really need to now, do they?
