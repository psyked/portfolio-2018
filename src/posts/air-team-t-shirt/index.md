A bit irrelivant I know, but I thought I'd post anyways as it's just arrived; 

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-830" title="AIR T-Shirt" src="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/03/airteamtshirt.jpg" alt="AIR T-Shirt" width="500" height="280" />

I got a free t-shirt from Adobe (yay me!). As it turns out, Shikha Bhargava - product manager for the AIR Marketplace - posted <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/logged_in/sbhargava_intro_air_marketplace.html" target="_blank">this article</a> on the Adobe Developer Center at its relaunch. <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/imagesizer-air-application" target="_self">ImageSizer</a> obviously sneaked in there as one of the first 10 new applications to be added, so I got a free t-shirt.  (As well as a free Digital certificate!)
