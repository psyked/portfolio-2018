[Shottts](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/30821 "View the Shottts application on the BlackBerry App World website.") is an AIR application developed for the [BlackBerry Playbook Tablet](http://uk.blackberry.com/playbook-tablet/ "Read more about the Playbook Tablet"), developed by Mark Starling, of [http://markstar.co.uk](http://markstar.co.uk "Open http://markstar.co.uk in a new window.") fame.

Shottts loads and displays a selection of the most recent updates from [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/shots/popular/ "Open the most popular shots from Dribbble in a new window."), and displays them in a nice, touch screen interface. I happen to know that earlier desktop versions of the Shottts application were kicking about privately before BlackBerry launched their submit-an-app-get-a-free-Playbook contest, so its nice to see the app finally go live!

And once those Playbook devices go on sale over in the UK, and Mark can actually get his mitts on a physical device, I'm sure we'll see more application updates. [You can read more from Mark about Shottts in his announcement blog post.](http://markstar.co.uk/blog/2011/flashplatform/actionscript/shottts-is-now-available-in-the-blackberry-app-store/ "Read more about the release of Shottts at markstar.co.uk")

If you've got a Playbook, I'd suggest you [check out Shottts](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/30821 "Download Shottts from the BlackBerry App World store.")!
