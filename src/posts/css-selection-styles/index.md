Did you know you could customize the selection colours of html pages with CSS?  I didn't - until now.  Turns out, there's a [CSS3 pseudo-element called ::selection](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#UIfragments "Open link in a new window").  Naturally, this isn't yet a technique supported by browsers like Internet Explorer, but it is supported in \[albeit with different syntax\] by Firefox and Safari.  Interesting, eh?  Check an article on [CSS Selection Styles from Quirksmode](http://www.quirksmode.org/css/selection.html "Open link in a new window"), and have a look at some of the creative effects you can get with it [here](http://metaatem.net/selcolor.php "Open link in a new window").
