Peter Elst posted something interesting - a counter-arguement to an article published in the "Inside Digital Media" magazine...

I haven't got a copy of the article, but Peter's post is interesting.  I think it sets the tone with this quote;
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>“Facebook, MySpace, Google and eBay are not made in Flash, that is undoubtedly due to the fact that at that time they were not able to agree on licensing terms with MacroMedia”</strong></p>
Pop over there and have a read -  see what you think.
