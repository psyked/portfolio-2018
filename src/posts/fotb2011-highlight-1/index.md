Here's one of my highlights from Flash on the Beach 2011 - something that I'd never seen before, but blew me away with its coolness.

HiSlope is a realtime video effects framework/library, which allows you to see and experiment with those effects in realtime.  The underlying coding framework sounds interesting, and the final effect is pretty neat.  I have a feeling I'm going to be messing around with it and picking apart the source code some time soon!

In the meantime, you can:
