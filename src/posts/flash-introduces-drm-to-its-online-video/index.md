The Flash Player is due to get built-in DRM, sometime soon.  Actually it seems odd that it's not already in there, but perhaps this means a little more flexibility in Flash video is on the way.  My initial thoughts on hearing about DRM are slightly coloured by the whole issue with music and DRM, but thinking about it, maybe if the Flash Player can handle the DRM itself, we can stop having to stream everything all the bloody time!

Here's a couple of links, which talk about this announcement in a little more detail;
