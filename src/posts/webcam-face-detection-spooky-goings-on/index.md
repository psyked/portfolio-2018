[![Augmented Reality Halloween](/content/images/2009/10/halloween.jpg "Augmented Reality Halloween")](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/RVEc4d1cd790afe4ac4be58071a72c98148,,.aspx)

Here's a bit of Friday afternoon fun for you.  I was playing around with some Actionscript face detection libraries last night, combined them with a webcam, some dynamic overlays, and voila! Augmented Reality, and just in time for Halloween too.  You will need a webcam to [try it out](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/RVEc4d1cd790afe4ac4be58071a72c98148,,.aspx) yourself, as it's just an early prototype, but we thought it was cool enough to stick on the company homepage for a short while.
