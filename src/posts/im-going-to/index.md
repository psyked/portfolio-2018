<a href="http://www.flexcamp.co.uk/" target="_blank"><!--more-->FlexCamp London 08</a> takes place on the 28th August (next thursday) - I'm going, and there's still places left so <a href="http://ria.meetup.com/7/calendar/8491887/" target="_blank">you can go too</a>. Now primarily I'm still a Flash developer, but given the amount of good things I've seen about Flex - ie. how much easier it could make my life - I'm really keen to get started on it again.

I have a subscription to <a href="http://lynda.com/" target="_blank">lynda.com</a>, a couple of Flex books - so now I just need to get hold of a students' Flex licence. But anyway, I'm going to FlexCamp - woohoo!
