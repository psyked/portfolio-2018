Foxmarks is a add-on for firefox, which syncronizes your bookmarks between computers. Soo, if you have your home computer and a work computer, for example, you can sync the bookmarks up automatically. Cool huh?

Well, where it could really come in useful would be in an office where everyone might want to have a common library of useful links in their web-browser. Anyone can add everything to a central sync server and bobs your uncle!
