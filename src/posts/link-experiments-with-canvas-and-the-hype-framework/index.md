Over at [markstar.co.uk](http://markstar.co.uk "Open markstar.co.uk in a new window."), you can see some cool experiments that Mark has been working on, and frankly the source code behind them is very cool.

![Look! Canvas!](/content/images/2011/03/canvas.png "Look! Canvas!")

The experiments themselves are based on the HTML5 Canvas element, and its drawing tools. Â The experiments are part of a series, exploring the initial Canvas element, and then quickly moving into some more familiar Flash-style drawing features, before exploring the possibility of converting the Flash [HYPE Framework](http://www.hypeframework.org/ "the HYPE Framework") into an HTML5 Canvas version. All pretty interesting - can't wait to see if he gets onto some of the really cool complex examples of the HYPE Framework.
