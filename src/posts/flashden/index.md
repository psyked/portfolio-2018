I'm surprised I haven't come across <a href="http://flashden.net/" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">FlashDen</a> before, but here's the deal...

FlashDen sells premade flash 'bits'.  It's like a marketplace, with every user able to buy and sell flash files, all for pretty reasonable prices.  (We're talking $2 - $30 here.)  And the files are anything from Preloader bars to fully-featured xml-driven portfolios.  It's worth a look.

Have I got anything on there?  No.  Have I bought anything from there? Not yet.  It's got a slick design though, and the Flash content is really inspiring.  Like, the kind of stuff I started learning flash for, but then forgot about.  I'm certainly going to be studying them for the future, though...
