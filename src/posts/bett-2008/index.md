Well, I'm off to the <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">BETT show</a> on the 9th (tomorrow)  I forget what BETT stands for, but it's an IT exhibition for schools / educational markets.  <a href="http://www.dynamic-learning.com" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">Dynamic Learning</a> is being shown off there - as well as being shortlisted for an award - and there's probably going to be a lot of SCORM / LMS related products on display so it should be an interesting one.

Although I suspect not quite interesting enough to warrent a followup post.
