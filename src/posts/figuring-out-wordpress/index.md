Wordpress is very flexible, as I'm sure you'd guess.  But how exactly can you get the best of it, from a coding point-of-view?

The danger with Wordpress, of course, is that'd you'd just create yet-another Wordpress Blog.  Default settings, popular plugins, familiar layout.  Undoubtably they all have their merits, but you'd be niev√© to think there wasn't room for improvement.  So, here's me, trying to improve on the Wordpress standards.  A little more thought into the information given on a per-page basis, for example.  Or different layouts, that sort of thing.

But first, I need to learn how to make Wordpress do what I want, and that's the point of this post.  After much fruitless searching, I eventually discovered <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags" title="Open this page in a new window." target="_blank">this page on Conditional Tags in Wordpress</a>, which gives you documentation, theory and examples for the more... selective displays of information.
