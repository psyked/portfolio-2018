Well, I've finally gone and done it - I've now got a project on Google code and I now feel like a proper part of the coding community.  We'll see how long that lasts.  I've just uploaded the first version of my [AIR ApplicationInfo](http://www.psyked.co.uk/actionscript/application-information-class-for-air.htm) class, and no doubt I'll be adding, extending and improving on it in the future - with the added bonus that now I'm not the only one who can contribute.  [You can access the project here.](http://code.google.com/p/psyked-as-classes/)

How did I do it?  Well, it's really all thanks to [Internet Duct Tape](http://internetducttape.com/)'s ["Getting Started with Google Code Hosting, Subversion, and TortoiseSVN without feeling like an Idiot"](http://internetducttape.com/2007/03/03/howto_google_code_hosting_subversion_tortoisesvn/) article, which does exactly what it says on the tin.  I got a Google Code project, learnt what the hell [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) actually does, and did it all within 10 minutes.

Awesome.
