This is some interesting <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2008/12/patchpanel.html" target="_blank">news from John Nack's blog</a> - about using a new SDK available from Adobe Labs called <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/PatchPanel" target="_blank">PatchPanel</a> to cross-script the Adobe Suite products (Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash etc.). PatchPanel is a library and set of services for enabling swfs to control Creative Suite products - so you can now develop and debug extensions with Flex Builder.

Kudos to Mark for sending me the link!
