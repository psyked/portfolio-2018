I've been exploring the [HTML5 Geolocation specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/ "Open the W3C specification for Geolocation") recently, and it's both fascinating and a little scary how accurate your browsers' Geolocation capabilities have become, especially if you're working on a machine with Wifi capabilities.

Inspired by this, I thought it would be cool to come up with some elaborate UAV interface mockup in HTML5 (so that it would work on iOS devices) and throw some cool stats in there.

As it turns out, I get bored too quickly and never finished these experiments, but my [initial prototypes are available here](http://www.psyked.co.uk/geolocation/). Sans explanation and documentation, of course.
