**Background:** I've been using Visual Studio Code for about half a year now, after giving it a try at the insistence of other developers at the office. Prior to this I used Jetbrains WebStorm and PHPStorm.

**The verdict:** My experience so far has been extremely positive - out of the box VS Code is pretty capable, and with the correct mix of plugins it can match almost any other IDE I've otherwise used, but with a much smaller memory footprint and faster startup time.

The plugins that I use for Visual Studio Code are:

### Functional plugins
* [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
* [JavaScript Standard Style](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenxsan.vscode-standardjs)
* [Sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robinbentley.sass-indented)
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)

### Language / Framework specific plugins
* [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker)
* [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur)
* [vue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jcbuisson.vue)
* [vue-beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=peakchen90.vue-beautify)

**In conclusion:** Out of the box, WebStorm is awesome. But plugins are a core part of Visual Studio Code, and the correct mix of plugins can bring it at least on par, feature-by-feature, with the competition. 

Comparing WebStorm and Visual Studio Code against each other, the only thing I've found to really distinguish them is that WebStorm has a more capable set of code refactoring and searching tools. Other than that, there's nothing that I use day-to-day that's missing.
