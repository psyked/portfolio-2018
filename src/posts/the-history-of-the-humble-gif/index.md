I'm a fan of [gif images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) as a method of communication - _particularly_ in our company Slack channel - and I love to learn a little more about the technology and development of various key aspects of the web, so I found the article ["The gif is dead, long live the gif."](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a21457/the-gif-is-dead-long-live-the-gif/) a fascinating read.
