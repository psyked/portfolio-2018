<a title="Open link in a new window" href="http://psdtuts.com/" target="_blank">Psdtuts</a> (Photoshop-document tutorials) hit the scene a little while ago on digg, and I've had it on my RSS subscriptions ever since.  Off like a dynamo with the Photoshop tutorials, I'd certainly keep an eye on it - looks to have potential to be another Smashing Magazine.  (i.e. A big hit)

Now, my knowledge of Photoshop is ok, certainly on-par with those I work with,  but Psdtuts? I'm a complete novice against them.  I tried to do a couple of their tutorials as a demonstration, but they didn't turn out so good.  They make it look so easy, but I guess you need some mystical, innate knowledge if you're going to compete.
