ASDoc is a command-line tool that you can use to create API language reference documentation as HTML pages from the classes in your Adobe<sup>®</sup> Flex<sup>®</sup> application. The Adobe Flex team uses the ASDoc tool to generate the Adobe Flex Language Reference.

Seb (a developer on the PPV3D team) shows you how to set this up in Flex Builder

I could've done with this earlier this week as I ended up using the Command Prompt instead!

Also if you're @author is coming up with the wrong name Seb shows you how you can change the default:
