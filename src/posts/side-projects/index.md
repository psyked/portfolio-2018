Mixing a full-time job programming and hobby-time job blogging is a tricky balancing act. To the extent where I could give up on the blogging side of things for weeks, months or even years and not feel too bad about it. After all, we’re not in this for money, we’re in it for the kudos and warm fuzzy feeling we get from passively helping out other geeks.

However this presentation, and the conversations it prompted with work colleagues, has convinced me to take up blogging again. Hopefully it will inspire you in much the same way!
