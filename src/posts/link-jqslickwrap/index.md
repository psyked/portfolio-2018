We've known for quite a while that jQuery is brilliantly clever, but holy cow, the code behind this is pretty damn clever.

<a href="http://jwf.us/projects/jQSlickWrap/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1051" title="jQSlickWrap" src="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/jQSlickWrap.jpg" alt="jQSlickWrap" width="500" height="280" /></a>

What jQSlickWrap does is automagically work out the shape of the image by extracting the background colour, and then modifies the HTML to wrap the text perfectly around the image. Â Obviously something so awesome won't work on some browsers, but it's designed to cleverly degrade to whatever your browser can manage, which is pretty fantastic.
