If you don't know what ORM is read the next paragraph, and it might help.  If you do, skip to the links below to learn a little more about how you can make ORM work with AIR and SQLite.

ORM stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" target="_blank">Object Relational Mapping</a>, in basic terms the concept of representing your tables-based data as more familiar objects and classes. Not a big concept after all, it's one that I've been using already in my AIR applications - albeit unwittingly and manually.  FlexORM is a project to assist and standardise this process, so it's worth knowing about and trying out.
