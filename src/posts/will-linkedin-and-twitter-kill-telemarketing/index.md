Will Hawkins asks, <a href="http://arryawke.blogspot.com/2009/01/will-linkedin-and-twitter-kill.html" target="_blank">"Will LinkedIn and Twitter kill telemarketing?"</a>. An interesting thought, based off a recent business experience where using Twitter and LinkedIn proved much more successful than hiring a whole telemarketing company.

I can't be bothered with Twitter too much - manly because I don't have a portable medium for Twittering, and I'm never <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/4/23/" target="_blank">doing anything Twit-worthy</a>, but I do use <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesford" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
