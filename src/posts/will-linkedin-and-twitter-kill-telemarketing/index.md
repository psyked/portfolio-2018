Will Hawkins asks, ["Will LinkedIn and Twitter kill telemarketing?"](http://arryawke.blogspot.com/2009/01/will-linkedin-and-twitter-kill.html). An interesting thought, based off a recent business experience where using Twitter and LinkedIn proved much more successful than hiring a whole telemarketing company.

I can't be bothered with Twitter too much - manly because I don't have a portable medium for Twittering, and I'm never [doing anything Twit-worthy](http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/4/23/), but I do use [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesford).
