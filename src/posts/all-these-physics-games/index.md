It seems like fun physics games are on the rise - there's <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/launchpad/launchball/" target="_blank">Launchball</a>, which I've <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/adobe/flash/launchball-an-awesome-flash-game.htm" target="_self">mentioned before</a> - but there also seems to be a rise in the numbers of other simple physics games created in Flash. Maybe its because of as3 libraries like <a href="http://www.cove.org/ape/index.htm" target="_blank">APE</a> making development easier, maybe commerical games like <a href="http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en_GB/" target="_blank">Little Big Planet</a> are what drive innovation (imitation?), maybe its even just down to the arrival of Actionscript 3 and its enhanced processing abilities.
Whatever the reason, games like <a href="http://fantasticcontraption.com/" target="_blank">Fantasic Contraption</a> and <a href="http://www.miniclip.com/games/magic-pen/en/" target="_blank">Magic Pen</a> have appeared on the scene, and are well worth a play.Â  (Just don't start playing when you should be working, otherwise you'll be in trouble.)

If you like those games, you can use classes like <a href="http://www.cove.org/ape/index.htm" target="_blank">APE</a> to start building your own...
