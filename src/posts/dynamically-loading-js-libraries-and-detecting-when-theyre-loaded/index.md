This is really useful - <a href="http://www.ejeliot.com/blog/109">http://www.ejeliot.com/blog/109</a> I've used it for some of my revised swfobject scripts - loading the latest version of swfobject from the<a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/hosted_library" target="_blank"> Google AJAX libraries</a> in the event that someone forgets to include the local version of the swfobject files.
