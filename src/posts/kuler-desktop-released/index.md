I noticed today that [Kuler Desktop](http://kuler.adobe.com/links/kuler_desktop_051707.air "Get the Kuler Desktop .air file.") has arrived. [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com "Open this link in a new window."), as [I've mentioned before](http://www.psyked.co.uk/2007/05/15/secret-weapon-1-kuler/ "Open this link in the same window."), is an awesome tool, and one which I first found out about through my research into Apollo. [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com "Open this link in a new window.") was always designed to be one of the first [Apollo aps](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Applications "Open this link in a new window."), a community colour-scheme orientated plugin for CS3. It was released early in [Flex](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/ "Open this link in a new window."), probably to build up a following, with the promised that the [Apollo](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo "Open this link in a new window.") one was on its' way. And now it's here. You can [download the .air file](http://kuler.adobe.com/links/kuler_desktop_051707.air "Get the Kuler Desktop .air file.") from [Kuler's subdomain](http://kuler.adobe.com "Open this link in a new window.").
