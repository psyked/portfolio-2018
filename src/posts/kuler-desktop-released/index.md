I noticed today that <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/links/kuler_desktop_051707.air" title="Get the Kuler Desktop .air file." target="_blank">Kuler Desktop</a> has arrived.  <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">Kuler</a>, as <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/2007/05/15/secret-weapon-1-kuler/" title="Open this link in the same window.">I've mentioned before</a>, is an awesome tool, and one which I first found out about through my research into Apollo. <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">Kuler</a> was always designed to be one of the first <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Applications" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">Apollo aps</a>, a community colour-scheme orientated plugin for CS3.  It was released early in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">Flex</a>, probably to build up a following, with the promised that the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">Apollo</a> one was on its' way.  And now it's here.  You can <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/links/kuler_desktop_051707.air" title="Get the Kuler Desktop .air file." target="_blank">download the .air file</a> from <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com" title="Open this link in a new window." target="_blank">Kuler's subdomain</a>.
