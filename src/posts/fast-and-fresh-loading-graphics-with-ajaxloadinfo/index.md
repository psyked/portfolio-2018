<p align="left">Here's a neat little site - <a title="Open link in a new window" href="http://www.ajaxload.info/" target="_blank">ajaxload</a>.  There's nothing better than letting your user know when they're waiting for something, and although a simple animation can't tell them the exact progress, or how much longer they'll have to wait - it's often the thought that counts.  Your preloader / loading animation is that little extra bit of finessé for your creations.</p>
<p align="left">And ajaxload has a lovely little generator to knock some graphics up for you, in a variety of formats and completely customizable colours.</p>
