Registration for Flash Camp '09 is open - it's in London on February 26th, and if previous events are anything to go by (which they are) then this is going to be well worth going attending. Â Unfortunately, in the interests of fairness, I won't be going this time (I got to go last time) but a few other guys from MMT Digital will be.

You can see more details on it, and register at: <a href="http://www.flashcamp.co.uk/">http://www.flashcamp.co.uk/</a>
