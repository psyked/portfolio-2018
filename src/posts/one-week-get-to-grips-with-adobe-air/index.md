<em>"James!"</em> they say, <em>"you've been dying to play with Flex and Air.  Make us an application to accompany our E-Newsletter!"</em>  How could I refuse?

<em>"You have until friday." </em>

I have unfortunately, no previous experience with Flex, Air or even ActionScript 3, so this is proving to be interesting.  Marketing has settled on producing an RSS reader - stay tuned and I'll let you know how things turn out in couple o' days.
