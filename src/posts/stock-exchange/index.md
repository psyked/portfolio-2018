Free stock photos? Easy. Stock.xchng ([www.sxc.hu](http://www.sxc.hu "Open this link in a new window.")) is a lovely little website that offers you just that. There's a little bit of liscensing on some images, and you have to register (for free, however) to view the full-size images, but that's all. It's cunningly tied into their sister site, [stock.xpert](http://www.stockxpert.com "Open this link in a new window."), which is of course, stuff you have to pay for.
