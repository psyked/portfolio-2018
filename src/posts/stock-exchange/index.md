Free stock photos?  Easy.  Stock.xchng (<a href="http://www.sxc.hu" target="_blank" title="Open this link in a new window.">www.sxc.hu</a>) is a lovely little website that offers you just that.  There's a little bit of liscensing on some images, and you have to register (for free, however) to view the full-size images, but that's all.  It's cunningly tied into their sister site, <a href="http://www.stockxpert.com" target="_blank" title="Open this link in a new window.">stock.xpert</a>, which is of course, stuff you have to pay for.
