I'm a bit of a slave to my own ideas - why else would I spend my evenings knocking together a whole host of not-really-nessesary features for a simple application?  I have to many ideas I want to impliment and too little time to do it, so I'm also acutely aware that I tend to break things without realising, when I try and rush new features through.  Hopefully though, it'll all turn out ok in the end!

Today's release of ImageSizer (version 0.4.3) introduces another new feature - the Feedback panel.  Essentially it's just a traditional e-mail contact form - heck, it doesn't even have any validation (yet) - but it should allow anyone who has any ideas or comes across any bugs to drop me a note from within the application.  Kudos to <a href="http://blog.pimpelsang.ee/" target="_blank">Eero Koplimets</a> for taking the time to suggest this feature!

You can download the latest and greatest version of ImageSizer from the badge in the right hand column, or upgrade automatically from a previous version by either a) Opening ImageSizer or b) Opening the Application Settings panel within ImageSizer, and clicking the button marked 'Check for Updates now'.
