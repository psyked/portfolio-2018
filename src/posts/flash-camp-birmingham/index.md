<strong>Flash Camp Birmingham</strong> is now open for registrations - it's on June 16th (2009), 12pm - 8pm.

It's gonna be great, of course - is organised by the <a href="http://flashmidlands.com/" target="_blank">Flash Midlands user group</a>, and is the first FlashCamp to take place in the UK outside of London.  Luckily for all who are used to everything taking place in London, Birmingham is only a single train ride from London. ;-)

There's quite a few interesting presentations arranged for the day: <a href="http://flashcamp.co.uk/schedule.html">http://flashcamp.co.uk/schedule.html</a> and plenty of information on how to get there: <a href="http://flashcamp.co.uk/venue.html">http://flashcamp.co.uk/venue.html</a>

Head on over to the website to register, and turn up on the day! (It's free!)
