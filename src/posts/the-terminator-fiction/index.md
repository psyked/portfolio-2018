Surfing BBCi's interactive tv services, I couldn't help take notice of one ominous sounding news report - "Skynet military launch postponed" - yee gads! <em>
Skynet</em> ?!

It gets better with this quote;
<blockquote>Software on the launch vehicle did not behave normally during a test sequence.</blockquote>
<em>Did not behave normally</em> (!) Suddenly I feel less worried about America's Cyber warfare division (due to become active on October 1st) and more worried about our own military systems.  I've always thought that the best way to make people believe reality is fiction was to make a movie about it (nobody believes movies are real, right?) and here we are, tempting fate. Uh oh.
