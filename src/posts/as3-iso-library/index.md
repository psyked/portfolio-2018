<p>AS3 ISO Library is a graphics library for easily creating and animating Isometric graphics.  It's a pretty funky style and there's some nice looking graphics in the demo pages for this site.  It's mainly aimed at making games easier to make in this style, but there's a lot of potential if you're creative enough.</p>
<p>It's amazing what kind of projects are out there!</p>
