<a href="http://www.scalenine.com" target="_blank">Scalenine</a> has always been a cool place to see some awesome Flex artwork - for ages now they've had lovely skins like <a href="http://www.scalenine.com/themes/obsidian/obsidian.html" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>Â or <a href="http://www.scalenine.com/themes/wmp11/wmp11.html" target="_blank">WMP11</a>, but they've recently ran a 'skin to win' competition and have released the winning entries on their site: <a href="http://www.scalenine.com/gallery/">http://www.scalenine.com/gallery/</a>.

The winning entries, and the article about them, can be found at <a href="http://scalenine.com/blog/2008/10/16/and-the-winners-are/">http://scalenine.com/blog/2008/10/16/and-the-winners-are/</a>...<!--more-->
