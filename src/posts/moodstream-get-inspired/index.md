<a href="http://moodstream.gettyimages.com/" target="_blank">Moodstream</a> is a pretty cool Flash piece from Getty Images, which displays a constant stream of video, audio and images, based on the mood you select from it's interface. As well as the cool idea - which works very well, by the way - the interface is innovative, slick and functional. Â A showpiece and source for inspiration in more ways than one.
