In the June 2008 edition of the Adobe Edge newsletter, there was an article <a href="http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/edge/june2008/articles/article2/index.html" target="_blank">"Learn how to geocode with Papervision3D and Adobe Flex"</a>.  You can also <a href="http://www.adobe.com/newsletters/edge/june2008/articles/article2/download/GeoGlobe.html" target="_blank">view the demo directly</a>.

Pretty awesome, eh?  All of the sample source code is available from the Adobe Edge page.
