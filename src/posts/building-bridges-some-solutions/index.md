In a non-too-subtle way, I thought I'd drum up a bit more enthusiasm for [this years' Christmas Game](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/Flash/ChristmasGame2009/Building_Bridges.html), by showing you a few of the solutions that people have come up with for the levels.

### Type 1: The Basic solution.

Oh yes, it works for the first level, but just you try that on some of the later ones...

### Type 2: Adding some support

That's the basic principle for solving the later levels...

### Type 3: Support overkill

One things' for sure, it ain't goin' down lightly.

### Type 4: The Leap of Faith

It doesn't all have to join up, you know.  You could just build ramps!

### Type 5: That's a ropey one...

Rope bridges. Flexible, and surprisingly strong.

### Type 6: The unconventional solution

Sometimes the best solution isn't the most obvious.

Like the look of that?  Well, go check out our [Christmas Game: Building Bridges](http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/Flash/ChristmasGame2009/Building_Bridges.html), and see what you can come up with!
