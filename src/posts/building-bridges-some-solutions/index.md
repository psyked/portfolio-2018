In a non-too-subtle way, I thought I'd drum up a bit more enthusiasm for <a href="http://www.mmtdigital.co.uk/Flash/ChristmasGame2009/Building_Bridges.html" target="_blank">this years' Christmas Game</a>, by showing you a few of the solutions that people have come up with for the levels.
<h3>Type 1: The Basic solution.</h3>

Oh yes, it works for the first level, but just you try that on some of the later ones...
<h3>Type 2: Adding some support</h3>

That's the basic principle for solving the later levels...
<h3>Type 3: Support overkill</h3>

One things' for sure, it ain't goin' down lightly.
<h3>Type 4: The Leap of Faith</h3>

It doesn't all have to join up, you know.  You could just build ramps!
<h3>Type 5: That's a ropey one...</h3>
<a href="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/ropey.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1082" title="Type 5: That's a ropey one..." src="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/ropey.png" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a>

Rope bridges. Flexible, and surprisingly strong.
<h3>Type 6: The unconventional solution</h3>
<a href="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/unconventional.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1083" title="Type 6: The unconventional solution" src="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/12/unconventional.png" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a>

Sometimes the best solution isn't the most obvious.
