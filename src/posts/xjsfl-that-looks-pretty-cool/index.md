xJSFL [<a href="http://www.xjsfl.com/" target="_blank">http://www.xjsfl.com/</a>] is a scripting library for extending the JSFL functionality of the Flash IDE. Its aim is to do for JSFL what the jQuery library did for Javascript which, by the way, was awesome.  Basically it extends the JSFL syntax to make it easier and faster to develop.

JSFL is a bit of a niché subject, so I can't imagine it's going to take off massively, but who knows.  I use JSFL from time to time, so anything that makes those boring tasks easier to automate has gotta be good - maybe this library will be the turning point for its popularity.  Or something like that.
