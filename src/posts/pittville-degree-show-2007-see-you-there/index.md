Well, today's the day.  No doubt some of the third-year students at Gloucester Uni are still working on their displays as we speak, but the <a href="http://www.glos.ac.uk/news/degreeshow.cfm" target="_blank" title="Open this link in a new window">Pittville Degree Show 2007 </a>is opening in less than 12 hours now.

I'll be along to see if they're up to scratch, and hopefully meet some more of my old uni buddies back there aswell.
