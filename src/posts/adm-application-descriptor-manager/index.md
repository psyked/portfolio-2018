<a href="http://www.dehats.com/drupal/?q=node/55" target="_blank">Application Descriptior Manager</a> is another application like the <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/09/beware_the_air.html" target="_blank">AIR Badger</a> and <a href="http://clockmaker.jp/labs/air_icon/" target="_blank">Icon Generator</a> - a development tool, built in AIR, for developing AIR applications.  It's useful, functional and has reassuring touches like auto-backup, or version upgrade buttons.

Once installed, you point it at an AIR application descriptor file, which it reads in, and displays the contents in a few simple flex forms.  Of course, editing the XML yourself isn't something that's out of the question normally, but the ADM application makes it all easier to manage - just like the AIR Badger does for the application install badges.
