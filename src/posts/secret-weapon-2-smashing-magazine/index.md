[Smashing magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ "Open Smashing Magazine in a new window") _('we smash you with the information, which will make your life easier. really.')_ is one of those pseudo-blogs, regurgitating content from other sites as a method of generating traffic. Well, at least that's what I assume. Behind the ads* there's a wealth of decent resources, and it's updated at a furious rate. For example, there seems to be 100 links+ in each of their '[Best of Month](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/digest/ "Open Smashing Magazine's Best of Month Articles in a new window")' articles. (and with that many links, there's gotta be **something good**)

They don't obviously write all this content, but seem to read and research everything that's going on through [digg](http://www.digg.com "Open digg.com in a new window"), [digital web](http://www.digital-web.com "Open Digital Web in a new window") and the like, and then prepare and serve it up in healthy doses every week (or more).

Head on over there, read their [past articles](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ "Open Smashing Magazine in a new window") and sign up to [their RSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-rss.php "Smashing Magazine's RSS feed"). You'll thank me later on.

\* remind me to do a post on how to remove them sometime...
