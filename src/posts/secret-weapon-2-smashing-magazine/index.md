<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" title="Open Smashing Magazine in a new window" target="_blank">Smashing magazine</a> <em>('we smash you with the information, which will make your life easier. really.') </em>is one of those pseudo-blogs, regurgitating content from other sites as a method of generating traffic.  Well, at least that's what I assume.  Behind the ads* there's a wealth of decent resources, and it's updated at a furious rate.  For example, there seems to be 100 links+ in each of their '<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/digest/" title="Open Smashing Magazine's Best of Month Articles in a new window" target="_blank">Best of Month</a>' articles. (and with that many links, there's gotta be <strong>something good</strong>)

They don't obviously write all this content, but seem to read and research everything that's going on through <a href="http://www.digg.com" title="Open digg.com in a new window" target="_blank">digg</a>, <a href="http://www.digital-web.com" title="Open Digital Web in a new window" target="_blank">digital web</a> and the like, and then prepare and serve it up in healthy doses every week (or more).

Head on over there, read their <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" title="Open Smashing Magazine in a new window" target="_blank">past articles</a> and sign up to <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-rss.php" title="Smashing Magazine's RSS feed" target="_blank">their RSS</a>.  You'll thank me later on.

* remind me to do a post on how to remove them sometime...
