Here's another cool library for AIR applications.  It works for both Windows and Mac environments, and uses the NativeProcess access of AIR version 2 to tap into the built-in voice synthesis functionality of the operating system.  It's still in development, is more developed for Mac than for Windows (at the moment) but it's looking pretty good already.

Should be a good one to have a play with soon!
