I may be slow on the uptake here, but Mr.doob has some awesome HTML5 and Flash Player showcase pieces over at <a title="Open &quot;mrdoob.com&quot; in a new window." href="http://mrdoob.com/" target="_blank">mrdoob.com</a>. It's hard to pick a favorite, because they're all darn impressive, but I'm a fan of the <a title="Open &quot;mrdoob.com&quot;s Face tracking and 3D Scene demo in a new window." href="http://mrdoob.com/90/Face_tracking_+_3D_Scene" target="_blank">Face-tracking and 3D Scene demo</a> (which I've screenshotted above).  It's based in Flash, because it has to access the computers' webcam, and is a pretty neat concept.

If it didn't require the whole webcam-access notification message that makes the whole effect so obvious, I'd definitely want to slide this into loads of projects, just for the hell of it!
