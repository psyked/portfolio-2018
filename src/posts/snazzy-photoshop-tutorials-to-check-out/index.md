There's nothing like a good round of tutorials to help your Monday morning procrastination inspiration. If you haven't already seen them, I'd suggest having a look at the following three Photoshop tutorials;

*   [Creating an Old-Collage effect poster](http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/creating-an-old-collage-effect-poster/ "Open link in a new window")
*   [Using Light & Shade to Bring Text to Life](http://psdtuts.com/text-effects-tutorials/using-light-shade-to-bring-text-to-life/ "Open link in a new window")
*   [Vector Polishing Techniques](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/vector-polishing-techniques/ "Open link in a new window")

And then have a look at this article / tutorial on 'the Polish' (aka. finishing touches)

*   [Elements of Great Web Design: The Polish](http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/elements-of-great-web-design-the-polish/ "Open link in a new window")
