<ul>
	<li><a href="http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/creating-an-old-collage-effect-poster/" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">Creating an Old-Collage effect poster</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://psdtuts.com/text-effects-tutorials/using-light-shade-to-bring-text-to-life/" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">Using Light &amp; Shade to Bring Text to Life</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/vector-polishing-techniques/" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">Vector Polishing Techniques</a></li>
</ul>
And then have a look at this article / tutorial on 'the Polish' (aka. finishing touches)
