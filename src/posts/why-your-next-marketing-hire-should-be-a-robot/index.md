**tldr;**
If your Marketing strategy doesn't *already* involve an automaton or some other form of repetitive work slave (interns don't count) it really needs an upgrade.

###For an Improved Customer Experience
Maintaining a customer base is easier when your customers have a good experience with your website.  One proven way to achieve a positive experience is for them to have a personalised experience, and a personalised experience can come from tailored communications and data-led interventions.

###Hire a Robot?
Unfortunately for your business, a truly personalised experience is a labour-intensive thing to construct and  maintain manually. You *could* send regular messages to individuals asking for feedback, you could offer them discounts, you could look at their shopping habits and try to capitalise on them, but you'll quickly hit a point where such activities stop being scalable without hiring more humans.

At that point, hire a Robot instead. Or at least, invest some time and/or money wisely and build yourself some tools to achieve marketing automation.

###[What is] Marketing Automation?
[Marketing Automation](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-automation-information) is a bit of a catch-all term, but essentially it involves breaking down business-to-customer communications into identifiable chunks and finding ways to replace a manual human process into a completely automated one.

> If you've ever got a (perhaps slightly impersonal) email from a company exactly 30 days after purchasing something, that's probably marketing automation at work. 

> If you get a chat window pop-up midway shortly after returning to a website shopping basket you'd almost abandoned, that's also probably marketing automation at work.

Put shortly, **everyone else is already doing it.** If you've not got automatons grooming your customers and making them feel special, **it's about time you looked at doing it as well.**
