Peter deHaan has posted a cool example of the way things work in the new Flex 4 'Spark' framework;

<a href="http://blog.flexexamples.com/2009/06/13/creating-a-fading-bitmap-fill-background-on-a-spark-panel-container-in-flex-4/">http://blog.flexexamples.com/2009/06/13/creating-a-fading-bitmap-fill-background-on-a-spark-panel-container-in-flex-4/</a>

The aim of the new Spark components is to make it much easier to customise the appearance of standard Flex components - similar to the <a href="http://www.degrafa.org/" target="_blank">Degrafa</a> project. If you're interested in either of these, then I hope you're already signed up for <a href="http://flashcamp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Flash Camp Birmingham</a>, June 16th 2009 (tomorrow), as <a href="http://jameswhittaker.com/" target="_blank">James Whittaker</a> of <a href="http://refreshingapps.com/" target="_blank">RefreshingApps.com</a> will be doing a session entitled <strong>"Skinning components with Degrafa &amp; FXG"</strong> which should be interesting!
