<p>MMT Digital's Christmas E-Newsletter is due out soon, so I thought it might be a pertinent time to recap our earlier email, the Autumn E-Newsletter.  And hey, this isn't just a company promotional post, I actually want to blog this, because I very much like the design and also because I wrote one of the featured articles!</p>
