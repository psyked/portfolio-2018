Working with a lot of Flash video (.flv) I'm acutely aware of the lack in decent, standalone FLV Players.  Sure, there's a few out there, but not many that are decent.  I have used <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://www.softpedia.com/progScreenshots/FLV-Player-Screenshot-27852.html" target="_blank">FLV Player 1.3.3</a>, but it's not up to much when you're trying to preview or edit files.  Adobe's own <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/productinfo/encoder/" target="_blank">Flash Video Encoder</a> is worse than id've thought it would be.  You can only encode once, and you can't decode, edit or view the files afterwards.  We have been promised the arrival of the <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Media_Player" target="_blank">Adobe Media Player</a>, but that's no comfort until it actually materializes.

By far the best solution for playing Flash Video so far is the <a title="Open this link in a new window." href="http://www.richapps.de/?p=48" target="_blank">RichFLV 2</a> - an Apollo-based desktop FLV Player.  It's in Alpha stage of production,  (isn't everything nowadays?) but it's already looking far more promising than any competition.
