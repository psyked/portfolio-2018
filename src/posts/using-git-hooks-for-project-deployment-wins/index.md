I'm amazed that I've never really used this before, but as well as using <strong>Git </strong>to manage your version history, you can also tap into built-in Git hooks to copy your project source code into another location after you've pushed your updates.

Essentially it's a cheap deployment process, and allows you to keep your source code repository and all its gubbins in one location, and serve your website from another.

DigitalOcean has an excellent tutorial which runs you through setting up this kind of thing on a Linux-based box, and that's available here: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-automatic-deployment-with-git-with-a-vps">How to set up Automatic Deployment with Git with a VPS.</a>
