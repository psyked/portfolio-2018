Wow.Â  If you haven't come across the 'Flugtag' site yet, I would highly recommend it - a highly interactive, user driven site, full flash, nice fun concept, exemplary interface, impressive Papervision 3D and all the other flash tricks that are out there.

After you've had a play, you might want to check out <a href="http://www.lessrain.com/" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">LESS RAIN</a>, or the <a href="http://www.blog.lessrain.com/?p=624" title="Open link in a new window" target="_blank">lessrain blog article</a> about developing the Flugtag site.
