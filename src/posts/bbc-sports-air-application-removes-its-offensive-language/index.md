Well, that was fast (and rightly so).  This morning I posted about the <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/adobe/apollo/bbc-uses-air-to-install-a-list-of-swear-words-to-users-machines.htm" target="_self">BBC Sports' Olympics AIR Application containing a text file of offensive language</a> but now, roughly 1.5 hours after posting here, and 6.5 hours after it being initally posted, a new update has appeared for the Olympics AIR Application.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-274" title="bbc-fixed" src="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2008/08/bbc-fixed.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" />

The release notes mention that it's updating the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">listing</span> events schedule (which it may well be) but it's also changing the contents of the <strong>bbc-swear.txt</strong> file to say '<strong>deprecated functionality</strong>'. (Instead of 1399 ways to swear.)

<!--more-->Our experence is that the auto-updater appears a little buggy - clicking update seems to start a background download process, and the installer kicks in when the application is fully downloaded.  Unfortunately without a progress indicator, it seems that things just aren't working.  Nevertheless, a little patience and your application should launch the built in Adobe AIR installer soon enough.

Fast (frantic?) work from the BBC!
