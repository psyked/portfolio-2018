It's coming up to 8pm on Sunday 28th, and that means the Workshops day for <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/" target="_blank">Flash on the Beach 2008</a> is over - but the fun begins again in only another 12 hours, with talks such as <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2112" target="_blank">"Brilliant Ideas that I've blatantly stolen"</a>, <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2194" target="_blank">"Mash-up widgets with Adobe AIR"</a> and <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2186" target="_blank">"Modulating a lot"</a> on the cards for tomorrow.

<!--more-->The day was good - I attended the <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2108" target="_blank">"ActionScript 3.0 for Designers"</a> workshop and Mark went along to the <a href="http://www.flashonthebeach.com/sessions/index.php?pageid=2188" target="_blank">"Papervision3D"</a> workshop.  Met new people, like 'Stu' from <a href="http://www.plagro.com/" target="_blank">Plagro Web Design</a>, recognised others from events like <a href="http://www.flexcamp.co.uk/" target="_blank">FlexCamp London</a> (<a href="http://www.peterelst.com/blog/" target="_blank">Peter Elst</a>), and just recognised some from their blogs (like <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/" target="_blank">Aral Balkan</a>, and <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/" target="_blank">Grant Skinner</a> (at least, I think it was him...)) 

Remarkably for a full days' staring at projection screens I didn't end up with a killer headache, but no time to ponder that because it wasn't long before we were off to get some food at the <a href="http://www.gbkinfo.com/GBK_Locations.htm" target="_blank">Gourmet Burger Kitchen</a>, shortly followed by a trek over to McDonalds to take full advantage of their free WiFi (because our hotel doesn't offer it!).
