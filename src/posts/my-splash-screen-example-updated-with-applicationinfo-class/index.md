As I've been playing around with the ApplicationInfo class, I thought my Splash Screen stuff would be so much nicer if it were a little more... generic?

So with that in mind, I've updated my Flex Splash screen project to impliment the <a href="http://psyked-as-classes.googlecode.com/files/applicationinfo.zip" target="_blank">ApplicationInfo class</a>, and use that to load information such as the version numbers, application names and application icons. Â Maybe it's not the most efficent way to do things, but what the hell, it's a good example for implimenting the ApplicationInfo class.
