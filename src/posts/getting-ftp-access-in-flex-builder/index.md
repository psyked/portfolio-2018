Little nugget of discovery for today;

> If like me, you hate having to open a separate FTP program to upload projects to a remote server you can install an FTP plugin for Eclipse, aka Flex Builder.  It’s not easy as pie to configure and it’s not so good with copying large volumes of files or folders, but it’s perfectly capable of uploading files to the server without having to leave your development environment.  I haven’t found a way of setting projects up to publish to a remote server yet, but at least it bypasses opening that separate program.

Here’s a little link that tells you how to install, configure and use the plugin: [http://www.venukb.com/2007/06/06/how-to-browse-remote-files-in-eclipse-ide/](http://www.venukb.com/2007/06/06/how-to-browse-remote-files-in-eclipse-ide/)
