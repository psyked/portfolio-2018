Ultrashock is one of those sites whose forums I tend to stumble around quite frequently on the 'net - but I've only recently taken a good look at it. The site itself is pretty impressive you know. It's mostly full browser flash, and a few of the interface elements gives away that it's based in Flex, presumably with some very custom UI elements.

There's the whole <a title="Open link in a new window" href="http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/" target="_blank">SWFAddress</a> deeplinking going on, Flash and Flex integration, and a very seamless transition to non-Flash elements, like the Forums and Wordpress powered blog. If you're looking for a showcase Flex site, here's a goodie. <a title="Open link in a new window" href="http://www.thefwa.com/?app=winners&id=6489" target="_blank">FWA</a> thinks so too.

What's more they're in the trade of selling content, kinda like FlashDen - which is cool.
