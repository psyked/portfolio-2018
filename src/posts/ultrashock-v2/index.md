Ultrashock is one of those sites whose forums I tend to stumble around quite frequently on the 'net - but I've only recently taken a good look at it. The site itself is pretty impressive you know. It's mostly full browser flash, and a few of the interface elements gives away that it's based in Flex, presumably with some very custom UI elements.

There's the whole [SWFAddress](http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/ "Open link in a new window") deeplinking going on, Flash and Flex integration, and a very seamless transition to non-Flash elements, like the Forums and Wordpress powered blog. If you're looking for a showcase Flex site, here's a goodie. [FWA](http://www.thefwa.com/?app=winners&id=6489 "Open link in a new window") thinks so too.



What's more they're in the trade of selling content, kinda like FlashDen - which is cool.
