I've been a bit slack on the External links side of things recently - but <a href="http://www.dezinerfolio.com/" title="Open link in a new window." target="_blank">Deziner Folio</a> really deserves a mention.  It's run by two guys - Navdeep and Navin.  Deziner Folio is slick, with a nice design, spiffy transitions and, well, generally good ideas with the interface, there's also a host of resources that they make available for download / demonstration - such as 'Web 2.0' Photoshop layer styles and various Image Gallery scripts.
