<h2>About this Video</h2>
This is a remix of Radiohead's "Nude" (known by its alternative title 'Big Ideas : Don't get any) performed on old computer parts. It was created by James Houston and [in his own words];
<blockquote>Based on the lyric (and alternate title) "Big Ideas: Don't get any" I grouped together a collection of old redundant hardware, and placed them in a situation where they're trying their best to do something that they're not exactly designed to do, and not quite getting there.

It doesn't sound great, as it's not supposed to.</blockquote>
Stick with the minute of static and it gets really good. Making busted up hard drives sing is quite an achievement by anyone's standards, but this is something else.
