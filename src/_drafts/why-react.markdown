title: Experience â‰  Years

I believe that it's important to have a deep understanding of a programming language if you're to use it on a regular basis, and that's the kind of thing that really only comes from exposure to a range of different scenarios. In other words, it's not the years of experience that counts so much as what you've tried to achieve with a particular language that matters. 

Once you've got the understanding of the language you're able to make a better informed decision about the way you approach a problem. Code that you write should be efficient, it should be clear and easy to understand, and it should be direct and not work purely as a side-effect.  I've written some superstitious code in the past, and I have no desire to do so again.

Some poor experiences with frameworks in the past have taught me that this same principle applies to frameworks as much as it does to the underlying language itself. Frameworks are designed around scenarios, to assist development, but if you try and solve a specific problem with the wrong framework it's likely to be as much of a hindrance as it is a help.

I also have a prevailing opinion that many libraries

But perhaps I've taken this too far.

It's for this reason that I've been shy to adopting things like React in my day-to-day development.
