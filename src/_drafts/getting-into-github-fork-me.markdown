title: Getting into GitHub (Fork Me!)
---

Waaay back in 2013 I presented this Slide Deck at work, talking about GitHub (specifically - not just Git the technology) and what its appeal is.  Much of this is still just as relevant today, but I feel that it's not quite so accessible just sitting [on Slideshare now](http://www.slideshare.net/psyked/fork-me), so I thought I'd repost it in picture format, with a little commentary.

###Fork Me!
Getting into **GitHub** for **fun**, ~~profit~~ ***kudos*** and all that jazz.

>First things first, GitHub is not the same as Git. Git is our source control technology, whereas GitHub is a website, a company, based around providing hosting for Git repositories, both private and public. 

###What's it all about?

>Anyone* can set up a Git hosting service, after all we use Bitbucket for our own stuff, so what makes GitHub any different to them?

>A lot of the appeal of GitHub is in the tooling - particularly around collaboration and management of projects. 

>The added value that GitHub provides on top of hosting the project is this layer of tooling, which they provide to open-source projects, which are in turn funded by the private clients.
