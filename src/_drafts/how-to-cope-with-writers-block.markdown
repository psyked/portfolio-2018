title: How to cope with “Writer’s block.”
---

People have given me a lot of advice, but very little of it I've actually found works for me. Thus, my advice comes with no guarantee.

## 1. Find your voice.
Trying to write in a style that is not your own is difficult until you can speak it fluently. It could be that your 'writing' voice is the same as your 'conversational' voice, it could be that it's something else. My favoured approach is to write as I would speak - a monologue with you, the reader - but with no second-guessing and presumptive questions.

You don't have to try and sound smarter and more eloquent than you would in casual conversation, and if you don't create yourself a high-minded, ideal version of yourself to live up to in your subsequent works then so much the better.

## 2. Be Confident.
A lack of confidence is an issue, and [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is all the rage these days. I don't really know if it's a generational phenomenon - something that just affects 'the millennials' - or it's one of those silent things that's always existed but has never been acknowledged, but it takes _confidence_ to put your ideas on paper and expose them to the cruel, cruel world of the internet.

If you don't feel confident enough to get writing, remember: 

1. If _you_ think it's worth writing, then it's worth writing _and_ publishing.
2. The chances of someone taking the time to bother saying mean things about your writing is minimal.

The way that you write, and the confidence with which you present your arguments is important.

If you've found your voice, you still need to find your passion, find your angle.

Persuasive Writing.

Review Paralysis.

## Get started, draft.

## Iterate.

## Set reasonable goals.

## Take breaks

## Quit while you're ahead.

The problem with writers' block is mostly in getting started. 
Everyone complains about it, and it's true that for every word you write the chances of it being the last one that gets read increases, so the beginning of your work is very important.
