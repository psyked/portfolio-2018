My online handle / username is predominantly **@psyked.**\n\n### Why this website/document exists\n\nWriting a self-README feels like a good way to share my own thoughts about working with myself, in a format that's curated by me and always available - unlike an email, Slack message or passing conversations which could get lost or misrepresented over time. [Plus, all of the cool kids are doing it.](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe)\n\n## About me\n\n### Personality\n\nBy some definitions I'm an Introvert, and by others an Extrovert. If you're interested, I come out as an [\"Architect\" (INTJ)](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) or a [\"Mediator\" (INFP)](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality) in Myers-Briggs tests, according to how I'm feeling. In practice that generally means that in chaotic or social environments I tend towards being more quiet and reserved, but I'm motivated by the feedback of other people rather than myself.\n\n### Social Media & me (other websites)\n\nI'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/psyked) and [Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/psyked/) I also have accounts on [GitHub,](https://github.com/psyked/) [GitLab,](https://gitlab.com/psyked1) [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/377961/james-ford) and [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesford/) I publish articles as often as I can on [Medium,](https://medium.com/@psyked) and mirror them on [GitHub Pages.](https://psyked.github.io/blog/)\n\n### Hobbies & Interests\n\nI read for pleasure and I enjoy writing. I prefer Science Fiction or Fantasy Novels and the occasional Thriller. I appreciate good, engaging writing.\n\nPokémon holds a special, nostalic, place in my interests; as does generative art. I'm also a fan of LEGO™, and fascinated by the development of Emoji - from both a technical and cultural point of view.\n\n### Professional Interests\n\nI'm interested in techniques and tools for managing teams of developers. Day-to-day I work with a React project in a Monorepo. I'm interested in things like HTML5 APIs, CSS and SASS, Docker, Jenkins, Node, Babel, Postcss, Redux and general architecture patterns for Javascript applications, in no particular order.\n\n## About this website\n\nThis is a static HTML website. It is generated by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the pages are a mix of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Markdown,](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages.](https://pages.github.com/) It's all open source, and you can see how everything works by looking at the source code.\n"}}]);
