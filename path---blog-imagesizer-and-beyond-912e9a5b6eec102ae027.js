ImageSizer 2 development is underway now, and there should be some more updates on the way.</p>\n<h3>And also...</h3>\n<p>As my code-signing certificates all went out of date, it makes it a little difficult for the automatic updates to keep everyone up to date.  The application source code is incompatible with the latest version of the Flex SDK, I want to re-architect the application source, and I think that the interface needs a complete re-think to integrate some of the newer application features.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can still <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&#x26;offeringid=10740&#x26;marketplaceid=1\">download ImagesSizer through the AIR Marketplace.</a></p>",frontmatter:{title:"ImageSizer -- and beyond(!)",date:"July 28, 2010",tags:["imagesizer","air-applications"],url:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
