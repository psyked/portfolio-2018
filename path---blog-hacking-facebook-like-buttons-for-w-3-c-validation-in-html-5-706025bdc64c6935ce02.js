That\'s because they make use of XHTML and namespaces. Sure, mixing XHTML and HTML5 together on a single page works just fine for the end-user, but when it comes to validating your pages on the W3C, it just won\'t work.</p>\n<p>What\'s the \'solution\'? Why, hacking it, of course. Take the code for those elements out of the source, and embed it with JavaScript instead. Â And it doesn\'t have to be complex either - you can use inline JavaScript code.</p>\n<p>Wrap your button embed HTML in a &#x3C;script> tag, add a CDATA block, and encompass it in a <code>document.write()</code> function, and you\'re done.</p>\n<p>So this code:</p>\n<script src="https://gist.github.com/1356698.js"></script>\n<p>Becomes this code:</p>\n<script src="https://gist.github.com/1356694.js"></script>\n<p>Of course, this being a hack, I can\'t really speak for this being good practice, but it works.  Evaluating the pitfalls will come later, I\'m sure!</p>',frontmatter:{title:'Hacking Facebook "Like" buttons for W3C Validation in HTML5',date:"November 11, 2011",tags:["facebook","html","html5","hacks","validation"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
