 Who cares that 44 thousand people have tweeted about the snow falling?  Not me.  What IS good though, is the fact that it\'s so quick and irreverant.  Full-on blogging takes ages to string together sentances to post.  Ok, you get more meaning across, but it takes longer.  Tweeting something takes a few seconds, and with a liberal smattering of keywords, lots of people read it.</p>\n<p>The TweetDeck search implimentation is a killer feature.  Setup a search on keywords, and moments after it\'s posted, it\'ll appear on your desktop.  Want to know if anyone\'s talked about something, put in a search and you\'ll find out.  I\'ve been tweeted twice this week, and I never even knew.</p>\n<p>Oh and building on the searches, it\'s a good way to seek out people interested in the same things as you, network, make friends, etcetera.</p>\n<h3>Follow me!</h3>\n<p>Hey, if you want to see what I tweet about, check out: <a href="http://twitter.com/psyked_james">http://twitter.com/psyked_james</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"I'm on Twitter.",date:"February 05, 2009",tags:["twitter"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/data-binding-an-array-in-flex/",tags:["flex","array","arraycollection"],title:"Data Binding an Array in Flex?",date:"2009-02-02T09:45:35.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/google-analytics-within-flexflash-applications/",tags:["flash","flex","air","google-analytics"],title:"Google Analytics within Flex/Flash Applications",date:"2009-02-05T13:30:06.000Z"}}}}}});
