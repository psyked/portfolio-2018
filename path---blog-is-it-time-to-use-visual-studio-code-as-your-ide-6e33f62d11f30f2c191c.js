Many on our Front-End Team are also WebStorm users, others are [Sublime Text](<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">https://www.sublimetext.com/</a>) users and one or two use [Atom.](<a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a>)</p>\n<p>Recently though, the strangest thing has happened - developers on the Front-End team and others _outside_ of the .Net team have been adopting [Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code](<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>) as their tool of choice for coding, and it\'s something that\'s been spreading through the team.</p>\n<p>![](/content/images/2016/12/home-screenshot-mac-2x.png)</p>\n<p>So, what\'s the appeal? We\'ve done some (mostly unscientific) tests of the features of each tool side-by-side and actually, Visual Studio Code is pretty good. Intellisense - historically one of Visual Studio\'s best features - is pretty darn good, Git source control is built-in, and it has themes and plugins for other bits of functionality. We haven\'t put the debugging tools through their paces yet, but it makes me wonder - is it time for Microsoft to claw back some market share in the land of Front-End development?</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Is it time to use Visual Studio Code as your IDE?",date:"December 28, 2016",tags:["microsoft","tools"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/poképroject-dev-diary-day-seven-dc096bdac274/",tags:["SEO","Digital Marketing","Hackathon","Pokemon"],title:"PokéProject Dev Diary: Day Seven",image:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*9N5G_8K-XFMZxRNJAYtpBQ.jpeg",date:"2016-10-06T21:01:01.030Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/explorative-prototyping/",tags:["hackathon","prototyping","programming"],title:"Explorative Prototyping",image:null,date:"2016-12-29T09:45:00.000Z"}}}}}});
