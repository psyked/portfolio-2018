This works in modern <a href=\\\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=download\\\">browsers which support the 'download' attribute</a> and <a href=\\\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas\\\">which support the 'canvas' element.</a></p>\\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\\n<p>In most browsers a canvas image can already be natively saved through the right-click menu, and what this technique is doing is essentially automating, or forcing, this action on the users' behalf. One of the advantages with this technique - besides the improved user experience - is that you have a chance to cleanly re-render the canvas element and essentially modify the output before the browser begins saving the image. </p>\\n<p>This means you can adjust the resolution, the aspect ratio, add watermarks or even modify the image data before it's downloaded by the user. Of course, the original right-click menu and functionality still exists, so you can't use this as a method of stopping users from saving your images completely, but it does mean that you can give them a better experience using your website.</p>\\n<h2>Real-world example</h2>\\n<p>I've used this technique on <a href=\\\"https://www.pokeproject.co.uk/\\\">PokéProject</a>, with what I call the <a href=\\\"https://www.pokeproject.co.uk/instagram/\\\">'Highresinator'.</a> PokéProject takes the pixel art from the original Pokémon GameBoy games, and scales it up from the original 32x32 pixel images into wallpaper backgrounds for desktop computers or mobile devices.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.pokeproject.co.uk/instagram/gengar\\\"><img src=\\\"/content/images/2017/04/pokeproject.png\\\" alt=\\\"Real world example on PokéProject\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>As you can see in the image above, as part of this process I'm generating a canvas-based preview of the wallpaper image, but that preview canvas isn't the correct resolution for any downloads. To fix this I've added a short form with download buttons, and clicking any of those buttons will generate the artwork shown on the canvas at the specified resolution.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/content/images/2017/04/downloadpokeproject.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Animated example of PokéProject\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Example code</h2>\\n<p>The key steps to this process are simple. First you have to generate an off-screen canvas element, into which you draw your image, and then you create an anchor element with a download attribute, transfer the users' click event to this element, and a download will be triggered.</p>\\n<p>Let's look at some sample code. </p>\\n<p>First, we're going to need a simple website which contains a canvas element:</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;html>\\n    &#x3C;head>\\n        &#x3C;title>Canvas Downloads&#x3C;/title>\\n    &#x3C;/head>\\n    &#x3C;body>\\n        &#x3C;canvas id=\\\"myCanvas\\\" width=\\\"100\\\" height=\\\"100\\\">&#x3C;/canvas>\\n        &#x3C;a id=\\\"downloadLink\\\" href=\\\"#\\\">Download Canvas&#x3C;/a>\\n    &#x3C;/body>\\n&#x3C;/html>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Next we use JavaScript to render something simple on the canvas - a bright red box, for example:</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script>\\n    var canvasElement = document.getElementById('myCanvas')\\n    var drawingContext = canvasElement.getContext('2d')\\n    drawingContext.fillStyle = '#ff0000'\\n    drawingContext.fillRect(10, 10, 80, 80)\\n&#x3C;/script>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/content/images/2017/04/preview.png\\\" alt=\\\"Demo preview\\\"></p>\\n<p>That works, but it's not very reusable - so let's refactor it a little:</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script>\\n    function renderCanvas(canvasElement) {\\n        var drawingContext = canvasElement.getContext('2d')\\n        drawingContext.fillStyle = '#ff0000'\\n        drawingContext.fillRect(10, 10, 80, 80)\\n    }\\n    var canvasElement = document.getElementById('myCanvas')\\n    renderCanvas(canvasElement)\\n&#x3C;/script>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>That's a bit more reusable - we're still doing the same actions, but we've made the canvas element that we draw to reusable.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/content/images/2017/04/rightclickpreview.png\\\" alt=\\\"Demo right click preview\\\"></p>\\n<p>Our users can currently right click on the canvas element and save it locally. Let's add a button which will perform this action for them automatically.</p>\\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script>\\n    function renderCanvas(canvasElement) {\\n        var drawingContext = canvasElement.getContext('2d')\\n        drawingContext.fillStyle = '#ff0000'\\n        drawingContext.fillRect(10, 10, 80, 80)\\n    }\\n    var canvasElement = document.getElementById('myCanvas')\\n    renderCanvas(canvasElement)\\n\\n    var linkElement = document.getElementById('downloadLink')\\n    linkElement.addEventListener('click', function() {\\n        var newCanvas = document.createElement('canvas')\\n        newCanvas.width = 100\\n        newCanvas.height = 100\\n\\n        renderCanvas(newCanvas)\\n\\n        let fakeDownloadElement = document.createElement('a')\\n        document.body.appendChild(fakeDownloadElement)\\n        fakeDownloadElement.setAttribute('href', newCanvas.toDataURL('image/png', 1.0))\\n        fakeDownloadElement.setAttribute('download', 'red-square.png')\\n        fakeDownloadElement.style.display = ''\\n\\n        fakeDownloadElement.click()\\n\\n        document.body.removeChild(element)\\n    })\\n&#x3C;/script>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>That's a lot of new code, but there's a few simple steps to this process:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>We create a new canvas DOM element, which is not added to the main page DOM and therefore is not visible.</li>\\n<li>We re-use our original canvas drawing logic, to draw a red box into our new (invisible) canvas element</li>\\n<li>We create a hyperlink element in the page DOM, set the element URL to be an bytedata representation of the canvas element (in png format as well, for transparency)</li>\\n<li>We set the 'download' attribute on the new element, specifying the download filename <em>and</em> changing the default browser behaviour and have it download the data as a file rather than trying to navigate to an URL</li>\\n<li>We fake a click event on our new hyperlink element, to trigger the file save</li>\\n<li>We remove the link element from the DOM and clean up afterwards</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/content/images/2017/04/canvaspreview-2.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Canvas download image preview\\\"></p>\\n<p>This code is currently just saving exactly what's in the canvas.
