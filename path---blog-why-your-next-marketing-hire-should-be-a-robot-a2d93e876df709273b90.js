One proven way to achieve a positive experience is for them to have a personalised experience, and a personalised experience can come from tailored communications and data-led interventions.</p>\n<h3>Hire a Robot?</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately for your business, a truly personalised experience is a labour-intensive thing to construct and  maintain manually. You <em>could</em> send regular messages to individuals asking for feedback, you could offer them discounts, you could look at their shopping habits and try to capitalise on them, but you'll quickly hit a point where such activities stop being scalable without hiring more humans.</p>\n<p>At that point, hire a Robot instead. Or at least, invest some time and/or money wisely and build yourself some tools to achieve marketing automation.</p>\n<h3>[What is] Marketing Automation?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-automation-information\">Marketing Automation</a> is a bit of a catch-all term, but essentially it involves breaking down business-to-customer communications into identifiable chunks and finding ways to replace a manual human process into a completely automated one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you've ever got a (perhaps slightly impersonal) email from a company exactly 30 days after purchasing something, that's probably marketing automation at work. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you get a chat window pop-up midway shortly after returning to a website shopping basket you'd almost abandoned, that's also probably marketing automation at work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Put shortly, <strong>everyone else is already doing it.</strong> If you've not got automatons grooming your customers and making them feel special, <strong>it's about time you looked at doing it as well.</strong></p>\n<p>Header image courtesy of: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/74471232@N00/4530183325/\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/74471232@N00/4530183325/</a></p>",frontmatter:{title:"Why your Next Marketing Hire should be a Robot.",date:"January 03, 2017",tags:["automating","seo","marketing"],url:null,image:"4530183325_23734995e8_o.jpg",description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/explorative-prototyping/",tags:["hackathon","prototyping","programming"],title:"Explorative Prototyping",image:null,date:"2016-12-29T09:45:00.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/rituals-dogma-and-the-agile-manifesto/",tags:null,title:"Rituals, dogma and the Agile Manifesto.",image:"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*bVOjeGtk6RJhFzhywjUDUg.png",date:"2017-01-04T13:17:00.753Z"}}}}}});
