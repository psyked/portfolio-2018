Many on our Front-End Team are also WebStorm users, others are [Sublime Text](<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">https://www.sublimetext.com/</a>) users and one or two use [Atom.](<a href="https://atom.io/">https://atom.io/</a>)</p>\n<p>Recently though, the strangest thing has happened - developers on the Front-End team and others _outside_ of the .Net team have been adopting [Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code](<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>) as their tool of choice for coding, and it\'s something that\'s been spreading through the team.</p>\n<p>![](/content/images/2016/12/home-screenshot-mac-2x.png)</p>\n<p>So, what\'s the appeal? We\'ve done some (mostly unscientific) tests of the features of each tool side-by-side and actually, Visual Studio Code is pretty good. Intellisense - historically one of Visual Studio\'s best features - is pretty darn good, Git source control is built-in, and it has themes and plugins for other bits of functionality. We haven\'t put the debugging tools through their paces yet, but it makes me wonder - is it time for Microsoft to claw back some market share in the land of Front-End development?</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Is it time to use Visual Studio Code as your IDE?",date:"December 28, 2016",tags:["microsoft","tools"],url:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/just-how-easy-can-you-make-an-air-application-installation/",tags:["air","auto-updater"],title:"Just how easy can you make an AIR application installation?",image:null,date:"2008-08-23T21:00:54.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/javascript-testing-with-node-js-testacular-jasmine/",tags:["javascript","karma","nodejs","presentations","testacular"],title:"Javascript Testing with Node.js, Testacular & Jasmine",image:null,date:"2013-05-06T11:43:08.000Z"}}}}}});
