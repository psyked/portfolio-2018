It's something that I first encountered a little while ago when I met people at conferences who were making visual notes, but it wasn't until I really started needing to write extensive notes myself that I gave it a try.</p>\n<p>Sketch notes might seem like a slightly more jovial approach to note-taking - and some people will even think you're simply not paying attention to proceedings and are just drawing doodles - but there's a little more down-to-earth seriousness to the idea.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally we all absorb information in different ways, and we recall and learn in different fashions, and sketch notes tap into our acceptance of that fact. Linear, text-based notes don't suit everyone and neither would a note-free environment. Some people write notes because they won't remember things otherwise, and others write specifically because the act of writing them will help them remember.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teachthought.com/pedagogy/literacy/10-brilliant-examples-of-sketch-notes-notaking-for-the-21st-century/\">TeachThought has a really great article on sketch notes.</a>\nTo pull a few key quotes from the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sketch notes–or graphic notes, or whatever other term you like–are one of the single most important developments in note-taking history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The point of notes [...] is to capture important ideas for future reference. While it’s nothing new to take notes that combine images with words and phrases, sketch notes are actually an evolution of this idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would really like to produce beautiful sketches every time I go into a meeting, but it rarely happens. Most of my output is a mess of intersecting lines, repeated underlines/outlines and interconnected boxes, but in the end my notes are not meant to be beautiful - they're done for my benefit, and because I find the output a useful tool for recapping a subject at a later date.</p>\n<p>And yeah, it's kinda fun as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/01/15538191_351822655185026_469369771456987136_n-2.jpg\" alt=\"My recent favourite note\"></p>",frontmatter:{title:"Scribbling away during meetings.",date:"January 24, 2017",tags:["notes","sketching","meetings"],url:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
