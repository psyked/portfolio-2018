And often one with little discernable gain. Did you know you can\'t use target attributes in link tags? Or alignment tags? Ok, so the alignment tags is a non-issue - we can do the same with CSS styles. But how, pray tell, do we achieve the feats we take for granted in HTML - target="_blank" ?</p>\n<p>I\'ve been pointed down the JavaScript road by several people, but I don\'t quite get how JavaScript is <em>the</em> solution after all, JavaScript made popup blockers what they are today. Nevertheless, here\'s <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/popuplinks" title="Open link in a new window">an interesting article from A List Apart</a>. They cover several solutions, most of which are ugly and, well, not a real solution to avoiding the target attribute. The final option they cover however, is just the charm.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/popuplinks" title="Open link in a new window"><img src="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2007/10/alistapartcom.jpg"></a></p>\n<h3>So, how does it work?</h3>\n<p>Well, the solution - if you can call it that - is a little more high-brow than the scripts I write from day-to-day, using listeners to hook into the click events of links, kidnap the urlrequest, and process it with JavaScript. The upside - you can leverage JavaScript onto any link, and perform far more complex tasks than the browsers\' built-in links. The downside? It\'s a lot of preparation.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"XHTML, Hyperlinks and separating content from style.",date:"October 15, 2007",tags:["html","javascript","hyperlinks","xhtml"],url:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
