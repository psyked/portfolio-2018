It ties into Internet Explorer, and uses it to capture a full or part screenshot of any website. It has all the native features your own Internet Explorer has, so Flash and Javascript and the like, all the features you need (cropping, resizing, resampling) and even full-page view. It\'s also free. (but without command line abilities) I found it while searching for some sort of wordpress plugin to replace my reliance on the Snapshots rollovers. Oh, I know such a plugin could exist, but it doesn\'t. Even so, getting screenshots on the web is now as easy as Open WebShot > Enter URL > Capture > Upload > Send to Editor > Publish.</p>\n<p><img src="/content/images/2007/06/websitescreenshotscom.jpg" alt="websitescreenshotscom.jpg"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Website screenshots made easy.",date:"June 05, 2007",tags:["external-links","downloadable-applications","screenshots","tools"],url:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/what-are-you-looking-at-introducing-screentweetr/",tags:["screentweetr","twitter","air","tweetphoto","twitpic"],title:"What are you looking at?
