Trying to break the habits, and go with purely gesture related interaction.  It\'s certainly thought provoking and a bit sci-fi-come-to-life, but what it really demonstrated to me is how much more appropriate clicking actually is.  Lots of work has gone into making this baby a functional reality, but without more tangible / tactile interaction, the whole experience is a little too alien.

The kind of portfolio I wish I had. <em>(maybe one day...)</em> It&apos;s very slick, natural to use, even as its&apos; slightly quirky.  It makes impressive use of filters, flash deeplinking, and has some good ideas regarding window focus.  Certainly an inspiration to give my &apos;portfolio&apos; a kick up the ass.',frontmatter:{title:"2 Smashing Flash Websites...",date:"July 20, 2007",tags:["design","flash","blogroll"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
