So long, in fact, that RSS readers are now built into the two major windows browsers, Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2. It\'s been inbuilt for longer on the Mac, I hear. So, in our busy little \'Web 2.0\' designs, why does the staple ingredient of Blogs and Community websites need to be emblazoned in the design? I mean, what\'s the point?</p>\n<p><img src="/content/images/2007/05/rssbling1.gif" alt="RSS.  Bling or no Bling?"></p>\n<p>Ok, let\'s backtrack my thoughts a bit. I was perusing <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2007/04/09/twenty-usability-tips-for-your-blog-%e2%80%94-condensed-from-dozens-of-bloggers-experiences/" title="Open this link in a new window.">this article</a>, which does a roundup of \'Usability Tips\' for your Blog. I consider myself a bit of a usability, uh.. well, a bit knowledgable on the subject. <strong>Point #3 is \'Make it easy to subscribe\'</strong> talking about RSS and Podcast subscribing;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Make it easy to subscribe to your feed by placing an orange RSS button in a highly visible location. Route your feed through Feedburner so you can keep track of your subscribers. You can also offer an e-mail subscription using FeedBurner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I disagree with this, however. If you\'ve got properly set-up links and metadata in your pages, your browser should be able to detect it, like this;</p>\n<p><img src="/content/images/2007/05/firefoxrss.gif" alt="Firefox RSS Detection"> <img src="/content/images/2007/05/ie7rss.gif" alt="IE7 RSS detection"></p>\n<p>So there\'s no real need for a big button, right? I suppose it\'s down to old understated / overstated design issue. If you want to look bright and shiny and \'Web 2.0\' you stick a big RSS button on. That way no-one will miss the opportunity to subscribe. Frankly though, I always read the content before deciding if I might want to subscribe to the RSS. If I do, i\'ll look for the RSS detection in my browser, which has to handle the process anyway.</p>\n<p>Usability is all about clarity and optimizing the click-process. So don\'t go overloading your pages with shiny buttons that aren\'t nessessary, and don\'t blithely add them because everyone else does. You\'ll thank me when the backlash arrives.</p>\n<p><img src="/content/images/2007/05/feed.png" alt="RSS Feed"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"RSS.
