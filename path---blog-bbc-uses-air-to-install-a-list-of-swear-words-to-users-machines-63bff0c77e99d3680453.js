Once it\'s installed, go to your application directory (Program Files) and <strong>BBC Olympics</strong> > <strong>assets</strong> > <strong>data</strong> > <a href="http://www.psyked.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/bbc-swear.txt"><strong>bbc-swear.txt</strong></a> and you\'ll be privvy to a 15kb, 1399 lines long list of bad words.</p>\n<p>This is such an ridiculous error that I’m practically lost for words. For an audience as big as the BBC’s you think they’d be mindful about offending people – every other part of the development must have undergone a review process – but bundling a highly offensive text file with your application?</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Perhaps there’s a reason for the BBC’s Olympics Application to contain a list of restricted words, but for the love of god, don’t store them in an unencrypted text file that’s written to the user’s hard drive - store it in a database format, a non .txt extension, encrypted storage, or even on a remote server – but <strong>do not store it as a text file!</strong></p>\n<h2>On the funny side...</h2>\n<p>Most of these words I haven’t heard since school, and many of them I’ve never heard of.  Although, beyond childish giggles, this isn\'t really funny - I don\'t think its nessessary, and looking at the contents, I have doubts about how useful it really is...</p>\n<h2>No really, why?</h2>\n<p>From an efficiency (programatic) point of view, the text file has some truly odd contents...</p>\n<p>If you’re going to search for the word ‘tosser’ then do a <strong>regular expression</strong> for the word ‘tosser’ – and perhaps a regular expression for the l33t-speak variant – don’t just search for these words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“to$$ers, to**er, to55er, to55ers, tosser, tosser, tossers, tossurs”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because a slight misspelling is going to get past, is it not?</p>\n<p>Anyway, there’s much that can be said about it - and I\'m sure much will be said about it.  <a href="http://www.ashorten.com/2008/07/17/bbc-olympics-coverage-on-your-desktop-with-air-and-on-the-web-with-flash-player/">Andrew Shorten</a> has been promoting it, I wonder what he has to say?</p>',frontmatter:{title:"BBC uses Adobe AIR to install a list of swear words to users machines.",date:"August 05, 2008",tags:["bbc","olypmics","swearing"],url:null,image:null,description:null}}},pathContext:{prev:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/exempli-gratia-using-tweener/",tags:["flash","actionscript","animation","google-code","open-source"],title:"Exempli Gratia : Using Tweener",date:"2008-07-18T18:53:31.000Z"}},next:{frontmatter:{path:"/blog/bbc-sports-air-application-removes-its-offensive-language/",tags:["air","auto-updating","bbc","olympics","swearing"],title:"BBC Sports' AIR Application removes its offensive language",date:"2008-08-05T15:39:07.000Z"}}}}}});
