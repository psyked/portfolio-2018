The bottom line is that ActionScript 2 content in an ActionScript 3 movie doesn\'t behave the same as an ActionScript 2 movie does on its own.  Certain things just flat-out don\'t work, or don\'t work \'a certain way\'.  Others that you thought did work actually work slightly or completely different, but do start working correctly with some encouragement.</p>\n<h3>Want some examples?</h3>\n<p>Goodness knows if they\'re always repeatable, but these certainly happened to me...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In AS2, draw a rectangle, with a width of 130 pixels.  Measure the width.  What is the width, according to Flash? 89 pixels.  Fan-tastic.  Cast the width as a Number (even though it was already a number) before you start drawing, and try again.  What is the width this time, according to Flash? 130 pixels.</li>\n<li>Dynamically generate an XML structure in AS2, using the <strong>addElement</strong> or <strong>createElement</strong> methods.  It works in AS2 on its own, nothing works when it\'s loaded as AVM1.  Rewrite the function to create everything as a String and call <strong>parseXML</strong> on it.  It all works.</li>\n<li>Try calling a function.  Function doesn\'t work.  Set an enterFrame listener, and call the function a single frame later.  It works.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AVM1Movie has done its utmost to ruin my sanity - don\'t let it ruin yours.
