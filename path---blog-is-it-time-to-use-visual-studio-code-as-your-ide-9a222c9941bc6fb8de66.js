We\'ve done some (mostly unscientific) tests of the features of each tool side-by-side and actually, Visual Studio Code is pretty good. Intellisense - historically one of Visual Studio\'s best features - is pretty darn good, Git source control is built-in, and it has themes and plugins for other bits of functionality.
