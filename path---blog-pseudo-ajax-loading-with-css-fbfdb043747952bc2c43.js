Voila! you have a new stat counter - or popularity counter, whatever.  They\'re great, but the practice of loading external javascript files outside the header of your documents isn\'t one that\'s too friendly on the page-display times.  In a sense, it\'s just like whacking a great big image onto your pages.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is an equally fashionable method for improving the effect that these scripts have on the page.  Using a simple animated graphic such as those from ajaxload.info and some CSS Wizardary, we can idenitify areas of the page that take a while to load, style them appropriately, and sit back in smug satisfaction.</p>\n<p>For our little demonstration, we\'re going to use a page hit counter from blogskinny.com, an image from ajaxload.info, and some CSS;</p>\n<pre><code>.ajaxload {\nbackground:transparent url(images/ajaxload.gif) center center no-repeat;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And to make the background image appear as we want it, we need to add the width and height properties of the image, with a bit of inline-css styles in a div surrounding the image.</p>\n<p style="width: 140px; height: 120px" class="ajaxload"><a href="http://www.blogskinny.com/" title="free counter chart from www.blogskinny.com"><img src="http://www.blogskinny.com/Chart/?u=1006_4615662faada" alt="get a free page counter with chart at www.blogskinny.com" border="0"></a></p>\nIt&apos;s a bit difficult to see, so try a Ctrl+F5 refresh and concentrate on the image!\n<p>It\'s a simple idea, and one I\'ll be using in my upcoming redesign of the site...</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Pseudo-AJAX loading with CSS",date:"October 28, 2007",tags:["css","ajax"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
