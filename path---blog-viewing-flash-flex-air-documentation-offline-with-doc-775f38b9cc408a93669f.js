It\'s darned useful if you want to refer to the documentation without going to the online LiveDocs, or you want to check the documentation without opening Flash/Flex builder (like, if you\'re using FlashDevelop). On top of all that, the search is faster and often more accurate than the standard search facility, and the application also looks pretty damn sweet.</p>\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-788" title="Doc?" src="http://uploads.psyked.co.uk/2009/03/doc.jpg" alt="Doc?" width="500" height="280">\n<p>There\'s even plugins for Doc?, which add the the application search to the Flash IDE and Eclipse. - Which you can see how to install and configure from the <a href="http://airdoc.be/plugin/" target="_blank">plugins page</a>. My only gripe with Doc? is that it has a bit of a user-interaction flaw - after you install the application, it\'s useless until you install the documentation. You can learn all about how to configure it from the <a href="http://airdoc.be/faq/" target="_blank">Doc? FAQ page</a>, and once you\'ve done that it works - but for all the cleverness of the application, it gives you no guidance about how to get started, and you have to find it out yourself.</p>\n<p>You can download Doc? from theÂ <a href="http://airdoc.be/" target="_blank">http://airdoc.be/</a>, the dedicated website.</p>',frontmatter:{title:'Viewing Flash / Flex / AIR documentation offline with "Doc?"',date:"March 04, 2009",tags:["flash","flex","asdoc","documention","eclipse","livedocs"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
