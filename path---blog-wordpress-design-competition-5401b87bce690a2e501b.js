Not that you\'d use that many, I hope.</p>\n<p>The competition runs until July 29th, with judgements made on the 6th August (when all of the entries will be released)</p>\n<p>I\'m gonna do my best to enter this one, and even if I don\'t, the theme sounds like a promising new base for a redesign...</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Wordpress design competition...",date:"June 07, 2007",tags:["design","wordpress","competitions"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
