You can then watch the video for up to 30 days after you've downloaded it online or offline. They've used a Flash Media Rights Management Server to DRM-Protect content so you shouldn't be able to get to the video file. Pretty cool stuff.</p>\n<p>You can find more info here: <a href=\"http://www.ashorten.com/2008/12/19/bbc-launches-iplayer-desktop-on-adobe-air/\">http://www.ashorten.com/2008/12/19/bbc-launches-iplayer-desktop-on-adobe-air/</a></p>",frontmatter:{title:"BBC Releases an AIR version of the iPlayer",date:"December 22, 2008",tags:["air-applications","bbc"]}}},pathContext:{}}}});
